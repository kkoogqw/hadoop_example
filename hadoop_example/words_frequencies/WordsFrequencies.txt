Now I know what its like to give birth at least in the conceptual sense Although the gestation period of 
this book was longer than childbirth its development parallels the emotions and activities of an 
expectant mother mood swings impatience anxiety cravings anticipation checkups having to 
choose a name and the frustration of several missed due dates 

I spent months organizing my thoughts before finally putting ideas on paper and into my tape recorder 
When I saw the Table of Contents and the Introduction taking shape it was like feeling the first kick I 
was filled with excitement and an overwhelming sense of trepidation This could have been my first bout 
of morning sicknessat least it felt that way I would wake up thinking What did I get myself into 
Can I really write a book that salespeople will actually read 

It appears weve done that I say we because this delivery is the result of a synergistic effort by many 
individuals The birth of anything is rarely a solo performance 
 Steps to Sales Success represents my deepest belief that selling is fun Selling is one of the most 
challenging yet rewarding careers in our society Sales entrepreneurs are emerging as one of the most 
sophisticated and important players in the business arena A sales career offers no end of promise and 
the excitement of endless possibilities Selling is a springboard to the fulfilment of all your goals and 
aspirations Its my hope that this book will help you and others discover or perhaps rediscover the 
joys of professional selling and that it will empower you to truly aspire to new levels of success Life 
validates that success is a matter of choice not chance Enjoy 



This Book 

As a professional sales trainer I have discovered a very important aspect of adult learning people love 
simplicity The simpler the better I wrote this book with that goal in mind to reveal the simplicity of 
selling Selling is simple Simple is fun That is why the KISS principle Keep It Simple Salespeople 
prevails This book offers an approach that strips away the perceived complexities of selling and 
discusses selling in its purest form a dialogue between two human beings 
The required skills of an effective sales professional have become increasingly sophisticated Todays 
customers are looking for a whole range of products and services to meet their business and personal 
needs Customers have become immune to traditional sales techniques Technological changes sales 
automation deregulation and the global economy have blurred many product distinctions at the same 
time stimulating a highly competitive selling environment Nowadays product and price alone will not 
sustain a competitive edge We have seen the demise of the obvious product solution Your product 
on its own will no longer stimulate a sale Your customers can buy virtually the same product at the 
same price elsewhere so why should they buy from you Customers appreciate a salesperson with 
empathythe ability to develop a total solution versus simply presenting a product They also 
appreciate the efficiency of new technologies high tech but still want the warmth of the human aspect 
high touch 

Sales productivity often gets sabotaged by the mechanics of selling Unfortunately in many cases 
selling becomes more of a strategic engagement with the enemy rather than a conversation with a 
potential ally to your business 

You are about to learn powerful proven techniques of professional selling As you master the techniques 
revealed in this book you too will experience new levels of productivity Expect your close ratio 
successful sales to number of sales calls to double No longer will you have to worry about missing 
your monthly or quarterly sales targets 
If you are like me the visual aspect represents an important part of adult learning Research suggests 
that most of the information stored in peoples minds enters through their eyes If your words conflict 
with your actions a listener will believe the actions I have taken my  years of practical sales 
experience and designed a visual representation of what the entire sales process looks like I am not 
aware of any other book that presents the entire selling process in visual form 

I write this book with the intent to share my accumulated knowledge and experience perhaps making 
your life a little easier Early in my career I discovered I had a propensity for sales After graduation from 
the University of Toronto in  I pursued my love of sales with corporations such as JM Schneider 
Inc and Gulf Resources I then spent eight years in the computer industry with Control Data 
Corporation five of them as sales manager 
In  I left the arena to found my own training company Spectrum Training Solutions Inc Since 
then I have worked with national and international companies and trained thousands of corporate 
professionals I describe my style of facilitation as entertrainment because I believe humor contributes 
significantly to adult learning and retention I invite you to visit our site at wwwspectraincom 

This book introduces you to a tool I use in all of our sales seminars the Sequential Model of 
Professional Selling The Sequential Model has been designed to foster confidence and success 
through its simplicity while revealing the common denominators of each sales call Experience has 
shown that a certain degree of consistencya common currencyexists throughout every sales call 

This model presents an uncomplicated approach to selling by delivering the core competencies of the 
entire sales process The strength of this model lies in the fact that its design and development were 
guided by input from several resources including my years of onthestreet selling input from 
customers feedback from thousands of sales professionals attending our seminars and interviews with 
hundreds of customers I still sell Like you Im out there every day dealing with the challenges the 
frustrations and the joys of professional selling 
Although each sales call is situational a logical sequential series of actions greatly increase the 
chances of making a sale This selling process involves the ten steps introduced in Chapter  Steps  
and  are important preparatory activities Steps  through  are related to interpersonal skills and 
specific selling skills All ten steps are discussed in detail throughout the chapters 




Of the thousands of sales books available most focus on limited aspects of selling Though you can 
purchase books about specific subject areas such as handling objections negotiating skills 
prospecting probing skills closing the sale and a host of other salesrelated topics very few books 
present sales as a complete process from start to finish I am not suggesting that other sales books 
are of no valuesome are very good In fact I periodically refer to other books that I encourage you to 
read and add to your personal library 

Throughout this book every aspect of the sales process is discussed in detail including effective sales 
negotiation and time management skills Consider this allencompassing book as your personal 
reference a resource to reinforce existing skills and introduce new skills As a successful sales 
professional you must continually search for any intellectual advantage available Simply put to earn 
more learn more 

Maximize Your Investment Six Guidelines 

To maximize the concepts of the Sequential Model of Professional Selling I offer these six guidelines 

 
Read the entire book This is the only way to fully understand the Sequential Model 
concept As you progress through the book ask yourself how you can apply and link 
each step of the model to your particular sales arena This book has been written for all 
sales professionals regardless of experience It presents a strategy that can be used 
by any salesperson to sell anything to any customer 
In  less than  of North Americans bought a selfdevelopment book and less than 
 of those actually read it Shocking My guess is that most people who buy a selfhelp 
book experience some degree of spiritual or career cleansing People take satisfaction from 
the fact they bought it proudly displaying it on their desk Their intentions are noble but 
seldom fulfilled 
You of course are different Thats why this book is in your hands By the way 
congratulations on your investment 
 
Keep the best toss the rest Now just a minute dont toss this book yet What I mean 
is that not all the suggestions and strategies within the Sequential Model will apply to 
your sales arena The Sequential Model offers a smorgasbord of ideas and suggestions 
Fill your plate with what is appropriate for you Every industry is unique so I suggest 
you examine each step closely and then determine whether to apply it If you discover 
just three or four new ideas that enhance your sales confidence then the investment is 
worth it My theory is that we improve and grow one idea at a time 
 
It may not be your way but its a smart way The Sequential Model will challenge 
your thinking and encourage you to reevaluate your current sales approach Change is 
difficult You may need to abandon old habits and embrace new behaviors Dont be too 
quick to defend your existing inventory of sales skills I appreciate that its difficult to 
surrender cherished techniques without protest However I invite you to reexamine all 
aspects of your sales habits My purpose is to stimulate the thinking process not as 
an event but as an ongoing continuous learning curve As professionals we often have 
to unlearn as much as we learn 
Have you ever stopped to notice how adept our customers are at changing They jump at 

the chance for bigger better faster cheaper and so on They dont seem to have a problem 

with it Whats our problem 

I suggest the corporate arena is the catalyst for much of the change we experience 
Businesses continually drive change I am not suggesting a wholesale change to your 
existing sales strategies but Im sure some of your skills could be enhanced or even 
replaced with smarter skills Hard work is not nearly as rewarding as smart work Sell 
smarter not harder 

 
The chapters can be used as individual references Although each chapter 
represents an integral part of the Sequential Model each can be read as a standalone 
resource You may find it helpful to refer to one specific chapter and refocus on that 



 
This is not only a book it is also a resource Refer to it oftenmake it part of your 
personal development library Mark it up highlight relevant sections It is amazing how 
quickly we experience intellectual evaporation Unless new information is reviewed and 
applied regularly we revert back to the easy way our old habits The goal of training is 
practice not competency Share this little gem with your manager noone becomes 
competent by attending one seminar or taking one lesson Learning is a sequential 
process not an event Selling is like a sport To become adept at golf tennis or any 
other sport we must practice practice and practice Only practice makes permanent 
There is no other way if you discover a better way call me collect 
 
Make it yours Take ownership of the skills you discover in the Sequential Model Have 
fun Simple is fun 
Equity means ownership You can have financial equity but you also require personal equity 
in terms of professional uptodate selling skills By reading and applying the strategies in 
this book you enhance your intellectual equity and your confidence to sell 

As you work through the book your enthusiasm for sales will be reenergized What other 
profession is financially rewarding guarantees you a job for life and gives you the flexibility 
to establish your own hours Outside of sports it is rumored that selling is the highestpaid 
profession in North America 





People appreciate good humor and there is no question as to its powerful effect on adult education 
Humor is the gateway to learning I like to think of it as the lubricant of learning With that in mind I 
introduce you to Bernie a rather hapless sorrylooking chap who will join us throughout the book 
Bernie will help us see the humorous side of a profession that can be fraught with highs and lows as we 
deal with uncertainty andor stress in a world of rejection 


We can all relate to his frustrations and mishaps as he pursues his sales career and works very hard to 
please his customers 





To encourage the attitude of entrepreneurial selling endorsed throughout the book I suggest you 
consider  Productivity Questions as you work through the Sequential Model They are designed to 
challenge your daily activities and embrace the role of a sales entrepreneur I refer to these  
Productivity Questions as the Tim Commandments Consider the Tim Commandments as your 
navigational buoys guiding your activities throughout the day As you master the Sequential Model 
strategies you will develop a newfound sense of confidence and personal satisfaction that will 
regenerate your enthusiasm for one of the most exciting and rewarding professions selling The Tim 
Commandments are spread throughout the book to guide you as you complete the steps 





Adult Learning How It Works 

If you havent read the Introduction go read it then come back Ill wait The Sequential Model of 
Professional Selling represents one of the fundamental principles of adult learning Learning is not an 
event It is a sequential process marked by stages of growth and development Learning is cumulative 
As we mature in life we come to know and accept this principle of continuous process A child must 
learn to crawl sit up walk talkand then to sell Even superstars like Wayne Gretzky and Tiger 
Woods had to respect the principle of sequential development Their parents were instrumental in their 
success and Im sure they would be happy to confirm the endless hours of practice required to develop 
the basics Attempts to shortcut the principle only result in disappointment frustration and a lousy 
paycheck 

Remember when you were a child wrestling with jigsaw puzzles or building model airplanes and ships 
When you finally put the last piece in place your proudly displayed finished project was most gratifying 
During construction you had to deal with several frustrations extra pieces missing pieces wrongsized 
piecesand the worst part not realizing you still had glue on your fingers until you rubbed your eye 

The good news is that the Sequential Model of Professional Selling has already been put together for 
youno assembly required It has no missing pieces and comes with an excellent users manualthis 
book The manual represents  years of my personal sales experience learning realworld selling 
skills on the street In fact feedback from my customers helped me write this users manual Unlike 
many other manuals this one is simple When you follow the instructions customers will cast their 
votes of confidence with orders A purchase order is the ultimate ballot of confidence The beauty of this 
model is that you can always add extra pieces by adding your own unique personality and your own 
selling skills You can be the architect of your own personalized selling style using the Sequential 
Model as your guide 

Although many salespeople constantly search for the secret of little effort big returns or the quick 
fix the selling profession is not immune to the principles of adult learning There are no shortcuts 





Guided by the principle of the sequential learning process I have developed the Sequential Model of 
Professional Selling Working with customers coupled with feedback acquired by training thousands of 
sales professionals has enabled me to create a model that is simple yet reflects all of the ingredients 
required to make a sale Figure  


Figure  The Sequential Model of Professional Selling 
The Sequential Model visually presents the ten steps of selling and helps clarify the selling sequence 
This is what selling looks like Each step of the model when learned and applied endows you with the 
capacity to advance to the next step Each step is related to all the others The final outcome of the 
sales interview is determined not by your ability to perform one step but by your ability to perform all 
steps throughout the execution of the sale Once again selling today requires a sophisticated set of 
skills 
Websters Dictionary defines model as  a standard or example for imitation or comparison  a 
pattern on which something not yet produced will be based That is exactly my objective to provide an 
example a pattern to be imitated throughout the sales call The Sequential Model provides the 
minimum acceptable standards on which to base your performance Anything less compromises your 
success The model gives you the confidence to effectively navigate through the entire sales call It is a 
guideline a blueprint that can be tailored to your specific selling arena 
Dont view the model as a rigid tenstep strategic engagement with your customer Each sales call 
must be situational guided by the spirit of the model It becomes a seamless interaction with the 
customera very fluid dialogue 

Beginning with Step  each step of the model must be successfully completed prior to advancing to 
the next step When I say successfully completed I am referring to success as defined by your 
customer To earn the right to advance the sale the customer must be satisfied with your performance 
at every step He or she is the ultimate referee of your performance Every successfully completed step 
sets up the next one steadily moving the potential customer toward a buying decision without pressure 
Consider your progress as a series of graduationscomplete the required curriculum of each step 
graduating to the next one Bypass a step or leapfrog a step and you seriously jeopardize the end 


result which is winwin Sorry no shortcuts No missing pieces allowed 

result which is winwin Sorry no shortcuts No missing pieces allowed 



To enhance our understanding and comprehension of customer I offer Websters definition as a logical 
starting point  a person who buys especially on a regular basis  a person with whom one must 
deal At the end of the day customers are the sole provider of every businessthe revenue stream that 
pays for everything else You can have the best product the best accountant the best management 
and so on but you have nothing without a revenue stream And the revenue stream is the direct 
contribution of sales period Nothing happens until something is sold 

Lets look at the six types of customers 

 
External Customer These are the people and organizations who have a need for your 
product or service They purchase your stuff in exchange for money They have a budget 
and will give you some of it in exchange for a solution that meets their needs and 
expectations Given that I affectionately refer to external customers as ones with the 
bag of money They have the financial autonomy to decide where and how they will 
spend their budgetthe bag of money The question is who gets the bag of money 
you or your competitor Who has earned the confidence and trust of the customer You 
and your competitor are vying for a piece of their budgetthe best solution wins Know 
this Customers vote with their money and complain with their feet 
 
Allies These are the users of your product or service not the ultimate decision maker 
These customers usually dont have a bag of money but they play a vital role in your 
success They do not make the final decision but they may have tremendous impact on 
the outcome They are often closely connected to the bag of money and positioning 
them as an ally to your cause is critical for your success You must earn their trust and 
confidence if you expect them to support you at the bag of money level A caution about 
allies They have veto power the authority to say no They can give you a hundred nos 
but cant give you the one yes needed to close the deal I have seen countless selling 
hours wasted on allies with the hope of closing the deal However allies can be a 
tremendous wealth of information Pick their brains and learn how you can differentiate 
yourself from the competition Customers buy differences not similarities It can 
sometimes be difficult to ascertain who the bag of money is and who the allies are Ask 
questions early in the call to determine whos who in the zoo Shrink your sales cycle 
by understanding the players within your accounts Simply ask them who else may be 
involved with decisions 
 
Internal Customer These are fellow employees and managers within your place of 
business They support you and make you look good to your external customers 
Appreciate them and treat them with respect Unfortunately they are often the victims 
of your blamefest The jerks in production screwed up again  or The idiots in 
shipping messed up    or Management gave me a lousy price    and so it goes 
Poor internal relationships can have fatal consequences for your external customers I 
recently saw an anonymous quote that supports my point We have less to fear from 
outside competition than from inside conflict inefficiencies discourtesy and bad 
service So true Take ownership for customer concerns After all you are an 
ambassador for your company so dont abdicate responsibility for late deliveries poor 
service and inadequate support Customers really dont care whose fault a problem is 
or how it happened Customers arent interested in fixing the blame 
They want to fix the problem Its up to you to quarterback all of the companys resources to 
resolve their problem 

When you work in harmony with your internal customers external customers become the 
beneficiary of your internal relationships In company after company I see sales working in 
isolation from other departments Sales cannot fly solo and expect to service the 
expectations of external customers Longterm success means having your entire company 
and all its resources focus on its customers 

Be aware too of your own personal internal customers such as family spouse and parents 
View your kids spouse or significant other as your personal internal customers They also 
deserve respectful treatment 

 
Repeat Customer They are the jewels of your business Do the job well the first time 
and you often get rewarded with another opportunity to serve them And guess what 

 

 
BornAgain Customer These are previous customers who no longer do business with 
you For some reason they have forgotten about you or they are still upset with you I 
suggest you dig up their file give them a call and settle any outstanding grievance Put 
your ego aside and offer restitution to satisfy the customer Do what it takes to resolve 
the situation Make amends Very frequently they will once again be receptive to doing 
business with you They often become loyal customers provided you resolve the 
problem to their satisfaction 
As you work with your customers you will find the Sequential Model is applicable to all six 
types Remember Pay particular attention to your internal customers 

 
Bag of Wind You guessed it these people have little or no impact on the decision 
They are often an easy point of entry into an account but they seldom contribute to the 
sales process In fact they do more harm than good by creating a false sense of 
authority There is nothing worse than wasting valuable selling hours on people who 
cannot help advance the sale However Im not suggesting to ignore these people but 
rather exploit their knowledge to deepen your understanding and confidence about the 
account They may also provide clarity as to who the allies are and who the bag of 
money is Knowing these people can prove to be a huge advantage knowledge is power

The sales profession has offered numerous definitions of selling With each writer this one included 
comes another definition another viewpoint However see what you think 

Its simple Selling is talking with 

 
The right person at 
 
The right time with 
 
The right solution for 
 
The right price recognizing 
 
The right time to confirm close 
I call these the five rights of passage Your sales call will only be as effective as the weakest right All 
five must work in harmony to advance the sale Imagine the frustration of trying to close the sale by 
talking to the wrong person at the wrong time with the right solution Therein lies the challenge of 
professional selling earning the right to advance the sale by executing the five rights of passage You 
must be in sync with your client throughout the entire Sequential Model or the sale is lost Worse yet 
you may end up forcing the sale and creating buyers remorse Thats where the sinking feeling of regret 
creeps into the customers mind These five rights give new meaning to the rights of a customer 
Another definition of selling is Selling is the process of disruption Ultimately you are there to 
facilitate change disrupt your customers current situation and improve their business by suggesting 
they buy from you Dont expect to walk into a prospects office and hear him or her say with 
enthusiasm Oh thank goodness a sales representative showed up We have done without for so long 
We were hoping someone would drop by soon 

It wont happen If selling were that easy youd be earning the minimum wage 





By this point you may have wondered if this book addresses advanced selling skills Legitimate 
question Let me answer it this way I recently worked with a client who was rather insistent on finding 
an advanced selling skills seminar During our discussion I suggested that success in a sales call is 
directly linked to performing the basics well We have all heard about professional sports teams 
recovering from a slump by going back to basics The basics never fail us Strive for brilliance at the 
basics 
I responded to my client by telling her there is no such thing as an advanced customer In my years of 
sales experience I have never heard of anyone referred to as suchtough maybe but not advanced I 
recognize that this is a new concept but I feel that customers simply represent a variety of positions 
some more senior than others Regardless of their position all customers have universal agendas such 
as why should I buy from you  how are you going to help my business  whats in it for me 
These questions are common denominators to every sales call Advanced selling is simply a matter of 
understanding and applying the Sequential Model coupled with having a positive attitude and the 
confidence to pursue a dialogue with fellow human beings regardless of their position or experience My 
client accepted the analogy and I proceeded to design a sales course using basic sales techniques 
that met her training objectives 
Consider this The Carnegie Foundation did a study and discovered that only  of a persons sales 
success comes from product knowledge Its not just what you know about your product but more 
importantly its how you present yourself This report went on to suggest that up to  of success in 
sales and life is determined by a combination of selfmanagement skills and interpersonal skills  
Other organizations also support these findings Think about it As a consumer when was the last time 
you purchased a product from someone you didnt like Not very often You probably took your 
business and your bag of money elsewhere 
In sales the common denominator the one universal constant is people People need to like you and 
trust you and to feel that you respect them before they buy from you It makes no difference what 
product or service you are sellingcorporations may do the deal but it is people who do the 
relationship People buy from people

A question I am often asked is What will be the role of the sales representative in the future My 
answer is The role of the sales representative as we know it today is disappearing The underlying shift 
is from sales representative to sales entrepreneur The role of a sales professional will not disappear 
anytime soon but responsibilities will include a sound knowledge of selling coupled with a professional 
code of conduct 

Unfortunately the profession of selling is saddled with a lousy reputation Rarely do we advertise our 
careers as Im in sales Its usually Im in marketing or Im in business development or I 
represent the XYZ company The actions of onedimensional sales representatives continue to fuel the 
lessthanstellar reputation of sales Most onedimensional sales representatives are motivated by the 
onetime hit get the sale at all costs and take no prisoners They repeatedly make canned 
presentations armed with little more than glossy brochures and a box of donuts Their basic need is 
survival Repeat business is not part of their repertoire The future offers no security for the sales 
representative 

Businesses are scrambling to differentiate themselves as they compete for a piece of those 
wellguarded corporate budgets Sales entrepreneurs are their key to corporate differentiation The 
facilitators of corporate differentiation will be sales entrepreneurs not traditional sales representatives 
Customers today no longer tolerate the onedimensional sales representative style of selling 
One of the objectives of this book is to foster a mindset of entrepreneurial selling Your future in selling 
lies in your willingness and ability to operate more as a business a minienterprise thinking as the 
president of ME Inc Sales organizations are slowly reshaping themselves in an attempt to foster 
entrepreneurial selling You are no longer servicing a territory but managing a business There is a 
groundswell of support within the business community supporting the role of the sales entrepreneur 

I am always amazed to see the lack of performance accountability at the sales level as some 
companies still accept soso sales results where performance falls short of revenue targets With 
nothing more than a verbal spanking the representative forges ahead optimistically into next year In 
future sales entrepreneurs will be held closely accountable for all salesrelated aspects of their 
business including margins profits customer satisfaction expenses and results 

I fully expect the future will endorse some form of certification or licensing for sales professionals In 
fact the International Standards Organization regulatory body is already looking at it 





Entrepreneurial selling also means less time spent in the office Sales representatives love to hang out 
at the office They tend to take refuge in the office shielding themselves from the hostile sales arena of 
constant rejection I refer to an office as an adult daycare center Sales representatives go into the 
office play with the other kids play with the corporate toys play on the Internet retrieve email half of 
which are junk swap stories of hardship at the coffee machine and generally appear to be busy They 
are often lulled into sedentary activities pursuing the art of busyness Some technologies even 
encourage the sales representative to hang out at the officethe fax machine is a classic Its much 
easier just to fax over information and perhaps place a followup callit will save a trip In fact upon 
receiving a request for information some salespeople will actually send a fax without so much as a 
followup phone call My preference is to make a facetoface appointment If that fails I will courier a 
professional customized package containing the requested information This method is professional 
and inexpensiveand courier packages still get attention Give it a try If I cant get in to see the person 
during my initial telephone conversation I set up a telephone appointment to follow up my package 
Dont get trapped in the adult daycare center Your job is to get out there and sell You cant hunt from a 
cave I recently heard another great line that makes a valid point If you want to kill half a day go into 
the office for an hour 

Entrepreneurial selling goes far beyond core selling skills As long as your customers continue to 
redefine their expectations successful selling will depend on developing and managing a more 
sophisticated set of skills Consider this Your goal as a sales entrepreneur is to disrupt current thinking 
of customers Challenge established buying patterns and facilitate change by way of relationships 
trust and conversational selling strategies ultimately satisfying both customer and corporate 
objectives In doing this sales entrepreneurs are guaranteed a job for life whereas sales representatives 
are quickly becoming dinosaurs The sales force of the future will be lean and mean equipped with an 
inventory of sophisticated skills possibly representing a mini corporate profit center The future will not 
be an option for sales representatives Compensation will be heavily weighted toward performance and 
success will be measured by the contribution your profit center delivers to the corporation 


The Sequential Model works only if you work it Notice it is not available in pill form There is no easy 
way no magic prescription The model must be applied and worked not once or twice but during each 
and every sales call It is a continuous loop regardless of the type of customer you are working with 
The model is timeless and works regardless of what you are selling or how long your sales cycle is The 
ten steps can be compressed and applied in a minute sales call or spread over a sales cycle of one 
year or longer Consider this book as your prescription to a healthier happier career as a sales 
entrepreneur 
Having just read this chapter some of you may be feeling a little anxious You have suddenly realized 
your business card reads sales representative the very title I have unceremoniously denounced But 
dont despair Dont think that all your customers will hate you and stop buying from you If they do its 
not because of how your business card reads trust me My intent is not to discourage you but rather 
to nurture an entrepreneurial philosophy I dont want to read in tomorrows paper Hundreds of 
distraught sales representatives were seen leaping from tall buildings as sales entrepreneurs looked 
on Seriously my objective is to foster a professional code of conduct guided by the qualities of a 
sales entrepreneur You dont have to change your business card simply change your outlook Your 




Common currency of a sales call includes trust rapport respect commitment and knowing that people 
buy from people Success today and in the future means recognizing changes within the sales arena 
Selling is more sophisticated today than it was even five years ago Although the core competencies of 
selling have not changed change is coming in the form of a longer list of responsibilities We must 
manage and embrace change so that it doesnt manage us

Overview 

Attitude determines your destiny quality of life and sales success The quality of your attitude affects 
the quality of your life These are profound statements but true The proficiencies of todays sales arena 
go far beyond selling skills Attitude is one of these proficiencies Without it all other skills are 
handicapped Attitude is what drives the practice of skills Attitude has such a compelling influence on 
selling that this book would be incomplete without a discussion on the five attitudinal characteristics of 
success Extensive product knowledge alone affords you little advantage if your attitude is one of 
indifference or if you lack belief in yourself 

The objectives of this chapter are to share with you the significant role attitude plays in your success 
and to examine the human aspect of business This book integrates the human side of business with 
specifics of professional selling The two cannot work in isolation As you develop your sales career 
you will be inundated with product knowledge company policies and procedures price manuals and 
other tools of the trade People often lose sight of the human side of selling Why does the sales 
profession complicate such a fundamental process We put on our business attire Monday morning 
then proceed to divorce ourselves from the human aspect of selling We become roboreps guided by a 
mechanical process Through a positive attitude you can refocus and develop a humanized approach 
with your customers 

A positive attitude will convert an average sales professional into a top performer It empowers you to 
achieve new levels of success both personally and professionally Winners choose to nurture and 
develop a positive winning attitude They understand the importance of a winning edge and use it to 
differentiate themselves in their own personal life and with their customers Attitude provides that edge 
People prefer to deal with winners 
One of the simplest and best definitions of attitude comes from Elwood Chapmans book Life Is an 
Attitude He suggests that Attitude is the way you mentally look at the world around you It is how you 
view your environment and your future  I agree Your field of perception and how you view your 
environment largely determines your attitude Is the glass half full or half empty While looking outside 
do you see the beautiful view or do you see the dirty window Is it a partly cloudy day or a partly sunny 
day Its up to you Who wants to do business with a grump Maybe other grumps Be aware that 
your nonverbal communication sends a very clear message about your attitude It comes through loud 
and clear as either negative indifferent or positive Two of these outcomes are bad You need to believe 
that what you mentally dwell upon significantly determines your attitude If you look for the good you 
find it If you look for the negative theres plenty of that around too You are what you think 

In examining the traits of topachieving sales professionals it becomes evident that it is not their 
product knowledge and selling abilities alone that set them apart Their habits and patterns of behavior 
reflect certain attitudes 
One of the challenges associated with maintaining a positive attitude is this little tidbit Psychologists 
estimate that up to  of what we hear and see throughout our day is negative We often experience 
mental negative drift  allowing the negative to dominate our thoughts Take a moment and think 
about a typical day How are you feeling by PM It takes conscious effort and energy to remain 
positive and energized throughout the day I find it interesting that when asked How are things or 
How are you doing today many people respond by saying Oh not too bad Not too bad Do you 
mean that most of the time you are bad but today youre not too bad Interesting Tell people you are 
having a great day Its okay youre allowed to have a great day Once again its attitude

To assist you in responding to the daily challenges of professional selling lets now examine the key 
attitudinal characteristicsthe five pillars of successpracticed by top achievers A positive attitude is 
a prerequisite to applying knowledge This section will not change things for you but it introduces you 
to the person who can 





Top achievers understand that life offers choice you can be an observer throughout your life or you can 
choose to be a participant You can choose to live life or choose to merely exist The choice you make 
determines whether you live with results or excuses No one becomes successful by watching 
someone else perform although lots of people try 

Many people appreciate the Nike slogan Just Do It It suggests taking action To me it smacks of 
procrastination Just Do It Yes but when Well soon someday Although it can be a good start 
Just Do It relates more to intentions than to actions The reality is that too often we judge ourselves by 
our intentions whereas others tend to judge us by our actions The challenge we face as adults is not a 
deficiency of intentions but a deficiency of action Intentions are easy We have lots of them Sadly 
intentions are little more than selfserving feelings of accomplishment Taking action is the hard part If 
we did everything we intended to do we would experience boundless success Successful people 
embrace the Just Did It philosophy They take their thoughts and ideas to the next dimension action 

People tend to procrastinate In fact it is how many of us start our day We usually swat the snooze 
button two or three times before we finally drag ourselves out of bed and into work Adopting the 
principles throughout the Sequential Model will encourage you to get out of bed because you want to 
not because you have a lumpy mattress The next time you purchase an alarm clock ask for one 
without the procrastination option 
Another handicap we face as adults is that we tend to look for the easy way the path of least 
resistance Procrastination becomes our worst enemy a kind of virus A dose of positive attitude is the 
antidote Life offers another choice we can choose to experience the pain of discipline or the pain of 
regret The pain of regret is costly and lasts a lifetime whereas the discomfort of discipline is rewarding 
and enhances your life Unfortunately pain of regret prevails I shared this theory with my youngest son 
Michael He thought the concept was pretty cool and has since embraced it himself The discomfort of 
discipline continues to enrich his life At  years of age he began taking lessons for his pilots license 
Six months later I witnessed his first solo flight A very proud moment indeed He is always reminding 
me to exercise the discomfort of discipline 

My eldest son Stephen was equally impressed with the Just Did It attitude Stephen completed the 
required training to become a member of the Canadian Ski Patrol System Focusing on his goal he 
persevered through two months of firstaid training passed his ski tests and became a fully qualified 
mountain patroller At age  he became the youngest member of the Canadian Ski Patrol System in 
Alberta Quite an accomplishment for a teenager Another proud moment for Dad 

We dont need to look very far to see how society has validated the impact of the Just Did It attitude 
Consider Bill Gates In  he was working in his basement pursuing his love of computers His 
mother said it was always a hassle getting him to come up for dinner At one point his motivation was 
probably financial but not anymore What keeps him motivated is the love of his work My father once 
told me that the true measurement of your love of the job is that you would do it for free Initially I 
thought he was nuts but now I couldnt agree more 

Every business today large or small was at one point a Just Do It idea with an action plan that came 
to fruition The company you work at now is the result of someone exercising the Just Did It attitude 
In fact over  of the places where we do business didnt exist five years ago What about the 
individuals who thought of Trivial Pursuit and Pet Rock to name a couple Im sure they are now 
basking on a beach while we toil away 

Here are a few suggestions to encourage the Just Did It attitude Buy yourself a thought into action 
tool Whats that you ask A handheld tape recorder a microcassettean excellent tool to have 
available while you are driving or at home You think continuouslygreat ideas or thoughts can pop into 
your mind anytime usually when you are driving or caught in traffic The recorder is very handy and 
provides the convenience to capture your ideas My own recorder has proved invaluable It has been a 
constant companion to me especially during the two years I took to write this book You will find it 
pays for itself in no time However I caution you be careful where you leave it My significant other and 
I were recently on a weekend ski trip On Saturday morning she had a bit of a smirk on her face With a 
degree of hesitation I inquired as to the look She told me I had been snoring As on previous 




The other Just Did It tactic I use comes courtesy of my father He would occasionally switch his 
watch to his other wrist After noticing this on several occasions I finally asked him what the heck he 
was doing He told me that because it feels so awkward on the other wrist it was a great way to remind 
himself to do something Go ahead switch your watch or even a ring It does feel awkward Next time 
you get an idea or think of a mustdo item switch your watch or ring Tying string on your finger would 
look silly You can switch it back only after you have taken action on your idea It works for me 





The second attitudinal characteristic found among top achievers is that they set goals They take 
advantage of the numerous benefits goalsetting offers Most of us view goalsetting as a laborious 
exercise fraught with uncertainty Did you know that only  of North Americans are committed to 
written goals  Im not talking about writing a todo list scribbled on a PostItNote or a napkin I mean 
a clear concisely written goal The todo list simply represents a shopping list of activities chores to be 
performed throughout your day As a sales entrepreneur you must get into the mental habit of thinking 
in terms of end results rather than being satisfied with busywork 
There is a parade of excuses as to why people do not set goals The most common one is They dont 
work or even worse How do I know what Ill be doing in five years Instead of creating our future we 
have been conditioned to react to the present Too many people today seek the quick fix hoping for 
some rescue fantasy to magically appear and salvage them from their boring life of routine and 
occasional luck 
In fairness to the goalsetting exercise recognize there are two sides to every story On the lighter side 
I offer you the top ten reasons why you may choose not to set goals 

Reasons Not to Set Goals 

 
No forward thinking is required 
 
You will always be successfulno accountability no disappointments 
 
Your week is already full Maybe youll set goals next week 
 
You have already reached your destination Life has little more to offer 
 
It gives you a good reason to keep buying lottery tickets 
 
You can hang out with other aimless drifters Likeminded people love company 
 
The  of North Americans who dont set goals cant be wrong They may be 
mediocre or very average but not wrong 
 
Youd rather live by other peoples goals Its easier if they set them 
 
No goals  no failure 
 
Todo lists work just fine for me 
Now of course I am being silly but these reasons to not set goals are scarier than you think I certainly 
hope you didnt highlight any of them Unfortunately many people do buy into this mentality 

Goals offer a host of benefits and the one that impresses me the most is that goals provide a 
destination How do you know where you are going in life if you dont have a destination Most of us 
spend more time planning our weekend holiday or party than we do our own lives We dont plan to fail 
we fail to plan You have probably heard or read these ideas many times before Thats because they 
are true Once again the path of least resistance and the pain of regret prevails 




b On a vacation c In a new home d In this elevator I cracked up Not only was the ad amusing it 
delivered a powerful message Unfortunately given that only  of us have written goals financial or 
otherwise Im sure d is the answer in most cases 
How To Set SMART Goals 

With an eye to simplicity I offer the SMART approach to developing your goals  Dont let the apparent 
simplicity of the SMART theory prevent you from using it It works Just ask your mentor or anyone you 
know who is experiencing success By the way if you dont have a mentor get one 
The SMART Approach 

 
Specific dates numbers times etc 
 
Measurable end result 
 
Attainable to me 
 
Relevant to me 
 
Trackable progress of goal  
All five criteria must be in place in order to achieve your goal Dont be overzealous Be realistic and set 
goals that are relevant to your environment and to your future Dont be guided or influenced by the goals 
of other people such as family friends managers or coworkers The SMART approach to goalsetting 
provides a way to articulate what you need to accomplish and where you are going 

The following example illustrates the simplicity of a SMART goal I will save  by December  
starting June  This goal satisfies the SMART criteria including when it starts Note that I didnt state 
I want some extra cash for Christmas I stated a very specific goal a SMART goal Now I have a 
destination My next step is to set shortterm goals to ensure I reach my destination of  by 
December  




Valuable Benefits of Setting Goals 

There are several important benefits of goalsetting The process 

 
sets a destination daily or otherwise 
 
clarifies purpose 
 
motivates you to action 
 
delivers a sense of accomplishment 
 
provides a benchmark of success 
 
validates that you are successful 
 
builds selfesteem 
 
provides a clear commitment 
The SMART process stimulates a clear commitment from you to achieve your personal and professional 
goals Commitment casts aside selfimposed barriers such as procrastination the virus I spoke of 
earlier Consider this story taken from Lee Boyans book Successful Cold Call Selling 
Well most people feel safer in a twinengine plane They figure if one engine quits you have another 
one to keep you up But consider this It takes a lot more pilot skill to keep a twinengine aircraft flying 
with one engine out Its terribly unbalanced Its especially tough in bad weather Worse if you have to 
make a forced landing in bad weather 

But pilot skill is only part of it The real reason you may want to consider a singleengine airplane safer 
is this If that engine quits the pilot is totally committed to land that bird There is no other option Total 
attention skill and effort are concentrated on bringing it down as gently as possible No distractions 

A twinengine pilot no matter how skilled isnt applying all of that skill to the one critically important 
task A twinengine pilots mind is going back and forth struggling with a dilemma Should I keep it up 
Should I bring it down  
I am sure many people drift through life like that They never fully commit to a specific goal They dabble 
in this and that not doing anything very well Dont simply try something commit to it Success 
requires unshakeable commitment Commit your full attention your energies and your skills to fulfill 
your goals If you only try something it becomes a very trying experience Be passionate not merely 
interested Dont be like the kamikaze pilot who flew  missions Get focused 

I recently set a personal SMART goal to lose  pounds within  days The goal kept me focused 
kept me on course and ensured that I did what was necessary Goals keep you focused regardless of 
whether you like the necessary activities I didnt particularly cherish the thought of dining exclusively on 
cabbage soup and veggies but those activities were necessary The discomfort of discipline 

Tim Commandment  


Set personal and professional SMART goals frequently 
Ask What are my personal and professional SMART goals for today for this week 


To further stimulate you toward action let me share some thoughts on motivation Much has been 
Dynamics of Motivation 
written on the subject of motivation Sales managers are always searching for the elusive magic formula 





Life only rewards players not spectators There is no admission charge for players but there is always 
a charge for spectators The spectators of life pay a high price for their admission and dont even realize 
it Life is not a spectator sport If you are not motivated by your career then get one where you are 
Motivation has two faces We can be motivated away from something such as a bad job or bad manager 
negative stress or motivated toward something such as a promotion or a new career positive stress 
As Abraham Maslow theorized we all live guided by a hierarchy of needs Once lowerlevel needs such 
as food and shelter are satisfied a person moves up to higherlevel needs such as esteem and 
friendship However Maslow also tells us that satisfied needs do not necessarily motivate us to move 
up to higherlevel needs We become content with what I call the FDH syndrome fat dumb and happy 
Satisfied needs do not motivate We must take responsibility for ourselves and set SMART goals to 
stimulate motivation Accomplishments and achievements are more satisfying than living with routine 
and monotony

Attitude  SelfEsteem Sell Yourself to Yourself 

Libraries offer a host of publications on selfesteem all offering various definitions In the interest of 
clarification I offer you my definition Selfesteem is the conscious appreciation of our own worth and 
importance the reputation we have with ourselves It is an attitude of acceptance versus envy Accept 
who you are and what you have rather than what you dont have Learn to be happy with what you have 
while you pursue what makes you truly happy 
Selfesteem not only empowers you to feel better about yourself but it allows you to live better The 
level of your selfesteem has profound consequences for every aspect of your performance and your 
existence Without question selfesteem is the most important of the five attitudes Selfesteem goes 
far beyond that innate sense of selfworth that presumably is your human birthright It is about 
confidence in yourself confidence in your ability to think confidence in your ability to cope with life and 
the confidence to recognize your right to be successful and happy To trust your mind and to know that 
you are worthy of success and happiness is the essence of selfesteem When you trust your mind 
you reinforce your worth and you will more likely persist in the face of difficulties and daily challenges 
Research suggests that individuals with high selfesteem persist at a task significantly longer than 
individuals with low selfesteem This reinforces trust in your mind If you distrust your mind you are 
more likely to be mentally passive to bring less awareness than you need to your activities and to be 
less persistent in the face of difficulty 

Personal SelfEsteem and Career Esteem 

Esteem includes not only your personal selfesteem but your career esteem as well Career esteem is 
how you feel about your job your company your boss your product or your service Are you 
committed to the career aspects of esteem If not you will probably want to take your job and shove it 
Your career attitude will come through loud and clear to your internal and external customers 

If you are not happy with the career aspects of your life consider finding another job Get paid for what 
you love to do When you enjoy your job everyone benefits at work and at home 

Success is often jeopardized by the selfimposed limitations of low selfesteem Many of us are our own 
worst enemies Perhaps the greatest liability sales representatives have is low selfesteem They often 
pursue sales careers handicapped by low selfimages Low selfimage and low selfesteem are further 
fuelled by the fact that sales professionals live in a world of constant rejection We are too hard on 
ourselves even before things go wrong Often negative selftalkthe conversation within our mind 
supports a predetermined outcome I cant do that  Ill probably screw up  I wont be successful 
And so it goes It becomes a selffulfilling prophecy I once heard personal and professional 
development expert Brian Tracy say We shoot ourselves in the foot and then admire our 
marksmanship  You must learn to appreciate your own worth and importance Well get to how you 
can do that in a minute Healthy selfesteem corresponds to rationality flexibility admitting mistakes 
creativity and a receptiveness to change Poor selfesteem corresponds to rigidity blindness to reality 
resistance to change and limited productivity  Where do you fit in 
Topachieving sales professionals have a high regard for self They believe in themselves and understand 
that you only sell as well as you feel When we feel good about ourselves our ability to be effective with 
our customers is enhanced However feelings are not facts Just because you may feel incompetent 
doesnt mean that you are incompetent Sometimes you may feel that you are not performing up to your 
usual standard but in fact you may well be By trusting your decisions and your judgment you enhance 
your sensitivity to your customers needs Your own insecurities may prevent you from focusing on your 
customer Without high selfesteem we live in a house of cards built on a weak foundation 

Three Ways to Build SelfEsteem 

To fuel your selfesteem I offer three suggestions 

 
Creative Visualization Use mental imagery to see yourself successfully engaged 
in sales situations or personal situations embracing new behaviors When you see 
yourself actually acting or thinking in a new way you begin to let go of old 
programming A new reality starts to take shape For your reality to change you 
must picture and accept yourself taking on the new behavior Some mental 
preparation is required prior to thinking positively The goal of visualization is to make 
the mental practice similar to the physical practice We must think positively before 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

we can act positively 
Visualization means seeing success before it happens See yourself on the podium prior 
to the event By visualizing success top achievers actually increase the chances of it 
happening We move toward what we picture in our minds A flushing of negative 
selfdefeating thoughts must occur before the mind can receive and act on new images of 
success Athletes have been using the advantages of visualization for decades They 
visualize the end result prior to the event itself They develop a mental blueprint to get a clear 
image of what needs to be done In his book Advanced Selling Strategies Brian Tracy talks 
about the value of a mental rehearsal prior to the sales call He suggests that Top sales 
athletes can use these same techniques as well to dramatically improve their performance in 
selling situations  
One of my earlier experiences with creative visualization was when I was teaching my 
daughter Lynn how to water ski on one ski Her earlier slalom attempts had met with 
frustration and disappointment She had fallen several times Not to mention that the gas 
gauge in the boat was falling as well We took a break and sat down on the dock and I 
asked her to close her eyes I then walked her through a mental picture of success where 
she could see herself up on one ski I had her confirm aloud what she saw and how she felt 
about it Well you guessed it On her very next attempt she got up on one ski It worked 
We were both elated In fact she almost fell again as she was filled with excitement and 
momentarily forgot what she was doing As Lynn and countless others have discovered 
creative visualization elevates your readiness to perform Give yourself a competitive 
advantage 

 
Balance A balanced life is another way to foster selfesteem Goals should not just 
be set in the area of business No one has ever said on his or her deathbed I wish I 
had spent more time at the office Top achievers set goals for all aspects of life If 
not they get out of balance and forget about other dimensions in their lives The six 
components of a balanced life are family health work spiritual intellectual and 
social Examine each one and make time for the things and people that really count 
in your life Successful people have come to appreciate the big picture and make a 
conscious commitment to personal development They have learned that becoming a 
wellrounded person has as much to do with pursuits outside the office as with 
professional development Success means having passion pursuits such as 
hobbies personal interests sports or other extracurricular activities outside of work 
These make for a wellrounded salesperson who doesnt live life as a couch potato a 
mouse potato or a spectator but as a participant 
The downside is that without a balanced life we fall into an activity trap constantly on the 
go We lose our perspective our energy and our sense of humor Life is not that serious 
lets take humor more seriously Humor prevents hardening of the attitudes Consider the 
mantra Think fast live slow 

Work complements your financial goals To develop your financial goals I suggest you read 
David Chiltons book The Wealthy Barber He delivers excellent strategies to achieve your 
financial goals all the while endorsing the KISS principle Davids book will also help you get 
out of financial quicksand Im sure everyone with maxedout credit cards can relate they 
spend themselves to wealth 

 
Read Read Read My final suggestion for maintaining high selfesteem is to read 
read read Read other resources and materials listen to audiotapes attend 
seminars and learn from successful people You simply do not have enough time in 
life to make all the mistakes yourself Learn from observing others Dont go through 
life learning and training by trial and error Its too expensive As a friend once said to 
me Do as I say not as I did Consider this if you think professional training is 
expensive try ignorance We cannot learn in isolation The more intellectual inventory 
you acquire the more resources you can draw on and the better you will deal with 
daily challenges and stress Strive to become mentally fit by feeding your mind with 
highly nutritious mental foods Feed it mental protein instead of mental junk food like 
mindless television shows and radio gibberish The average North American spends 
upwards of  hours a week in front of the television and  hours on the Internet It 
wouldnt take that many hours with a good book to distance oneself from the pack 
Many adults continue to live on a diet of mental pabulum only digesting what is 
absolutely necessary nothing more What you take in today transcends into the

person you become tomorrow 

Build your personal development library at a rate of one new book every month I suggest you start by 
reading Dale Carnegies classic How to Win Friends  Influence People Its a must read for people in 
all walks of life To earn more learn more 

Two Types of Knowledge 

Every day we are bombarded with new information new technologies and new and improved products 
all representing new knowledge But in fact where we are today technologically is comparable to 
where the aviation industry was in  We aint seen nothin yet I like the statement from author 
Warren Bennis The factory of the future will have only two employees a man and a dog The man will 
be there to feed the dog The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment Again we 
must unlearn as much as we learn One of the greatest gifts you can give yourself is to learn how to 
learn 

My theory is that there are two types of knowledge core knowledge and peripheral knowledge During 
our lifetime we acquire core knowledge math science language skills which remains constant 
throughout the centuries eg      and will never change Peripheral knowledge is the stuff we 
learn that reflects current technologies and current philosophies Peripheral knowledge is perishable it 
comes and goes We appreciate that it may very well be obsolete in ten years Newly acquired 
peripheral knowledge should come with a best before date stamped on it For best freshness utilize 
this knowledge before the year  Just as we clean out our refrigerators we need to purge our 
minds once in a while An example of peripheral knowledge is keyboarding a skill currently taught in 
high schools Keyboarding is a classic example of peripheral knowledge that is already becoming 
obsolete Keyboards are being replaced with voice recognition and voiceactivated computers already on 
the market Many products we enjoy today are vulnerable to technological obsolescence as the lifespan 
of products continues to shrink at an alarming rate 
A combination of core knowledge and peripheral knowledge is the key to personal and corporate 
survival As I mentioned earlier the competitive arena demands acquisition of knowledge and constant 
investment in career development We must continually search for any intellectual advantage available 
The acquisition of new knowledge fuels selfesteem However I caution you knowing is different than 
applied knowledge In Napoleon Hills book Think and Grow Rich he makes a good point Knowledge 
is only potential power It becomes power only when and if it is organized into definite plans of action 
and directed to a definite end   One of my national accounts Dun  Bradstreet has a great 
expression Knowledge allows you to play applied knowledge allows you to win 

Stay in school by becoming a lifelong student of your profession Unquestionably knowledge is the 
currency of the future and todays world takes little pity on those who remain lazy about learning 
Lifelong learning is a form of personal insurance Protect your future

Attitude  Comfort ZoneStretch It 

As two caterpillars were returning from a day of fun in the sun they noticed a beautiful butterfly 
overhead One caterpillar looked at his friend and said Gosh look at that Youd never get me up 
there 
This classic comfortzone syndrome is familiar to most of us We go through life living within our limited 
range of experiences our comfort zone hesitant to explore new experiences and venture into the 
discomfort zone The discomfort zone is unfamiliar territory outside of our existing inventory of 
experiences A comfort zone includes life experiences that feel natural safe and normal to us Been 
there done that got the Tshirt 

To further our understanding of the comfort zone we must discuss our subconscious minds No doubt 
you have some awareness of the workings of your subconscious as hundreds of books discuss the 
subject My interpretation of the subconscious mind is that it represents an inventory of all our life 
experiences a warehouse full of perceptions beliefs and selfimages Our subconscious mind is our 
comfort zone 

All our conscious thoughts and daily experiences positive or negative contribute to the building of our 
subconscious mind Our subconscious mind thinks in pictures We become what we see If we think 
failure we get it If we think success we enhance our chances of achieving it Henry Ford said it best 
Whether you think you can or cant you are probably right Our subconscious minds impact on our 
behavior is so allembracing that it becomes the single biggest barrier to growth to stretching Our 
subconscious rules We minimize stress and anxiety when we act within what is appropriate to our 
subconscious If we see ourselves as losers then we are But as Zig Ziglar says Failure is an event 
not a person Remember that 

Most of us are risk aversewe are constantly searching for security content to live within our 
established comfort zones These life experiences or behaviors have been repeated for a long time we 
take comfort in the predictability of the outcome We respond within our established repertoire of 
behaviorsour comfort zone Stretching our comfort zone involves embracing a totally new activity 
something never before experienced bungy jumping skydiving or for some of us making cold calls It 
must be a totally new adventure never before experienced to qualify as a stretch Im not talking about 
going to a new restaurantthat doesnt cut it as a stretch As the saying goes even a turtle has to 
stretch its neck out to get ahead 

Venture into the Discomfort Zone 

Top achievers realize that growth comes only by setting goals that require them to stretch their comfort 
zone Yes stretching adds an element of risk It seems a lot of people dont understand that the 
rewards come after the risk not the other way around To experience the rewards of life we must pay 
up front Interestingly enough we never know when we will be rewarded but the rewards do come 
Those who dont invest up front always search for the easy way convinced that it exists Dont go 
through life picking only the lowhanging fruit 

As children we are always exploring taking risks and trying new adventures Unfortunately as we age 
we become more rigid in sticking within our comfort zone If we inadvertently venture into the discomfort 
zone or we are forced into it we immediately attempt to recoil back into our comfort zone We cocoon 
ourselves in our comfort zone protecting ourselves against possible failure or embarrassment 

Successful sales entrepreneurs are not necessarily more competent but they do look for ways to grow 
and stretch They willingly expose themselves to new things by venturing into the discomfort zone Use 
your comfort zone to rest in not to live in Use it to consciously relax and reenergize as you visualize 
performing your next challenge 

Take a piece of paper or even at the bottom of this page write down the last time you willingly 
experienced a stretch Give it some thought Drawing a blank Dont feel bad most people do Note that 
I said willingly not accidentally On a personal note I would like to share a story where I stretched my 
comfort zone I went skydiving I climbed to  feet and jumped out It was a tandem jump where 
the jump master was strapped onto my back and he had the parachute The two things I liked best 
about my tandem jump were freefalling for a full  seconds at  mphwow and the jump master

assuring me he was anxious for a successful jump as well You see sometimes life itself presents us 
with challenges that take us out of our comfort zone forcing us to experience new things It may be a 
spouse parents boss or sales manager forcing us to stretch Dont be like our caterpillar friends and 
wait around to experience a forced stretch With that thought let me ask you two provocative questions 

 
When was the last time you did a first time 
 
How old are your stories Ouch 
You may not like the answers but your customers expect you to be interesting as well as interested 
Venture out and get some new material 

Tim Commandment  


Use visualization and SMART goals to stretch yourself 
Ask What iswas my stretch for the month 


I offer two strategies on how to stretch your comfort zone Some stretches are planned others are 
spontaneous unplannedimpromptu 

 
Planned Plan to engage in a new activity I will set a goal to do X by the end of the 
week This gives you time to prepare and visualize your success 
 
Spontaneous See an opportunity and go for it Dont wait around thinking about it or 
hoping it will come back another day 
I like to be spontaneous although I did plan the skydiving I Just Did It Another suggestion is to 
experience ministretches to start slowly building your confidence to stretch Dont feel you have to 
jump out of an airplane tomorrow 

Let me share another realworld example of how the Just Did It attitude coupled with SMART goals 
worked in harmony to achieve the desired result of stretching the comfort zone While facilitating a 
customer service seminar I used the example of bungy cord jumping as a classic comfortzone stretch 
and asked if anyone had experienced it The only response was from Lawrence aka Slim He said he 
intended to do it but was too broke using the financial angle to procrastinate A bungy jumping facility 
was available only minutes away My cofacilitator agreed it would be appropriate to take Slim and the 
group on a little field trip The rest of the group and I kicked in the cash required for Slim to make the 
jump 

Slim jumped willingly He Just Did It It was great to watch discomfort of discipline in action Within 
two hours of Slims mentioning he wanted to do it we removed the barrier and he did it We returned to 
the seminar and of course Slim didnt learn a darn thing the rest of the day He was bugeyed and as 
high as a kite intoxicated by his new experience He got the Tshirt and the video He couldnt wait to 
share his new experience with his wife and friends He was so proud to say I Just Did It The same 
type of opportunities are open to you 

What makes experiencing a stretch so attractive is that my informal research suggests that 
approximately  of the time people respond to their new experience by saying Wow that was 
great Id do it again Most people do it again because the next time is simply repetition replacing the 
initial fear with enjoyment What Slim and countless others have learned is this Fear dissolves by way 
of participation There is no other way Nonparticipants live with fear anxiety stress and wellrehearsed 
excuses This baggage spills into your career eroding your enthusiasm your drive and your 
commitment There are no limitations to the frequency of stretching and experiencing new things All 
you need is permission from yourself My next personal comfortzone goal is scuba diving I dont feel 
particularly comfortable under water but its something I plan to pursue My son Stephen is a certified 
scuba diver and he tells me Its awesome After all I have a  chance of enjoying it

Attitude  Patient Yet Persistent 

Patient yet persistent an oxymoron Not necessarily As a sales entrepreneur one of the biggest 
obstacles to your success is lack of patience Statistics suggest that less than  of sales are made 
on the first call and over  are made on the fifth call However only  of sales representatives ever 
return for the third call   They quit and go back to the adult day care center to hang out with other 
frustrated sales representatives 

Look around you and you will see mostly quitters Maybe there is one in your mirror Consider this The 
average person who takes up a musical instrument quits How many people do you know who play a 
little piano or a few chords on the guitar They tire of it quickly as results come too slowly They go 
on to look for something easier Likewise many people who start night school fitness programs or 
sales careers quit The examples are endless Many of us are great starters but poor finishers 


This is great news for those of us who truly desire to be successful It means that if we stick to it we 
will be ahead of the pack Jack H McQuaig a pioneering psychologist claims that the one defining 
factor of success in sales is persistence There is lots of room at the top History is alive with classic 
examples of persistence Thank goodness for the likes of Edison  tries before the light bulb 
worked Einstein Bell Michelangelo the Wright Brothers and Alan Hobson and Jamie Clarke They 
never gave up On May   Alan and Jamie finally reached the top of Mount Everest on their third 
attempt Alan said this from the summit If there is a lesson in all of this it is that if we persevere long 
enough we can do the dreams 

If you call a potential customer once a year are you persistent What about twice a year Once a 
quarter once a month once a week Are you persistent The answer to all of the above is yes Even 
by calling once a year you are demonstrating persistence You are saying to the customer Im still 
here Im not giving up Harvey MacKay talks about how he has not met a qualified customer he hasnt 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

sold Some took a whiletwo to three yearsbut he sold them Persistence When do you give up on 
potential customers When they die Even then introduce yourself to the new person 

Silver Platter Syndrome 

One of the better sales videos I have seen presents the silver platter syndrome Although the video is 
probably  years old the message remains powerful The premise of the silver platter is that the 
average sales representative gives up after only three or four calls to a potential customer However we 
know that  of sales calls are closed after five calls but only  of representatives ever make the 
third call The silver platter works like this You make the first call and the second call generating some 
interest from the customer After the third call the customer may not be sold yet but is probably 
interested You have piqued their interest to maybe  However having made your two or three calls 
you give up moving on to the next potential customer Once again instant gratification prevails and 
sabotages the sale Your competitor shows up shortly after you have abandoned the customer or you 
simply gave up The customer still at an  level of acceptance now entertains your competitors 
proposal How much selling did your competitor have to do Only  Gottcha You just handed that 
sales opportunity to your competitor on a silver platter He or she should send you a thankyou note 
saying Thanks for giving up I only had to do  of the sale Have a nice day 

My question is this How many potential accounts are you working on where you may be exposed to 
the silver platter syndrome Better check it out How often have you given up on a customer relationship 
but later discovered that your competitor who was more persistent got the sale Its frustrating and 
unnecessary The attitude of persistence will not eliminate the silver platter syndrome but it will certainly 
help minimize it Stay focused on the accounts that will truly contribute to your business even if it 
takes a year or two to close them 

The problem once again comes back to human frailties Human beings crave instant gratification and we 
pursue it with a passion seducing us away from the task at hand compromising our focus and 
deviating our energies Why take six months to possibly close account X when I can probably close 
account Y tomorrow 

No one is immune Our world moves along at breakneck speed as we satisfy our quest for instant 
gratification Businesses compete with cutthroat aggressiveness to deliver their products faster bigger 
and better Heck even the beer companies responded by introducing the big mouth beer can We can 
now drink beer  faster We have drivethrough coffee eating banking and oil changes In California 
you can experience drivethrough marriages and when you die friends can pay their respects at a 
drivethrough funeral home Inarguably the antidote to instant gratification is patience and persistence 
We must be persistent to remain competitive but all the while patient enough to work within the 
customers timetable Even in California drivethrough customers do not existat least not yet 

Sales representatives and customers are often out of sync during the sales process Sales 
representatives are guided by their agendas whereas the customers are guided by theirs Dont let the 
lure of commissions bonuses or quick sales sabotage your patience Dont close the deal on your 
timetable in the interest of a fat paycheck Its all too common for sales representatives to sell what they 
need to sell versus what the customer needs to buy This is further fuelled by corporate incentives One 
more sale and I win the TV or I might win the parking spot for the month Sales managers put 
additional pressure on representatives by demanding they hit monthend or yearend targets A huge 
gap is created between the sales representatives selling agenda and the customers buying agenda

It Begins with YOU 

When you pass away an autopsy will never reveal your attitudes They are human qualities that are 
very personal very subjective and controlled entirely by you Attitude not only determines your final 
destiny in life it also determines what kind of journey it will be The bottom line is that you are where 
you are in life because of the choices you made Your job your income and your spouse are all a 
result of your choices The only things you cant change are your parents siblings taxes and death 
Take ownership of yourself and start living life to its fullest We need to stop rehearsing our excuses and 
accept total responsibility for ourselves Life sometimes resembles an iceberg We only realize maybe 
 of our potential and we shortchange ourselves by  of a great life Our life is so abundant with 
opportunity we just dont realize it When we nurture these attitudes within ourselves we naturally 
increase our capacity for meeting just about any challenge with energy optimism and a positive 
outlook 

Its sad to see the number of people who surrender their lives to mediocrity I recently read on a flower 
shop sign Treat each day like a gift thats why its called the present It all begins and ends with 
YOU Your Opportunities are Unlimited

What I Told My Daughter 

When my daughter Lynn turned  I wanted to impress her with some fatherly pearls of wisdom 
something she would remember and cherish the rest of her life This is what I told her Honey now that 
you are an adult from here on in nobody cares about you She was crestfallen She said Wow Dad 
thats harsh My point is this and it applies to all of us Other than your parents who really cares about 
your personal success or hardships in life Nobody Who cares if you are the CEO of ME Inc or 
picking bottles off the street Nobody Yes your manager has a corporate interest in your performance 
but if you do not perform youre fired Your spouse may love you today but if you do not commit to the 
relationship it erodes and youre divorced Your coach may support you but if you do not contribute to 
the team youre traded and so it goes Nobody cares other than the few people who may express 
sadness and sympathy for your plight Its a rather sobering message to tell a daughter and to share 
with readers but unfortunately life is not very tolerant of those who do not take ownership and 
responsibility for their decisions Lynn did not particularly appreciate my little gem of advice but she 
understood it It was a big bite out of the reality sandwich However the good news is this By 
practising these five attitudes that lead to success sales entrepreneurs can expand their confidence in 
their abilities These high achievers will emanate positive energy and display a high level of commitment 
to their personal life and to their profession 

The best time to develop a lasting positive attitude is during the good times Consciously build on the 
five attitudinal pillars and use them as a catalyst to heighten your success Dont find yourself reacting 
to bad times struggling to combat low selfesteem or low selfworth Consider this Chinese proverb 
Dig the well before you get thirsty Or give this some thought The best time to fix a leaky roof is on a 
sunny day Something else to consider If you think you have it tough spend an afternoon visiting the 
burn unit or the cancer ward at your local hospital Its a rather sobering shocking experience Trust 
me it wont take long before you quickly appreciate how good things really are Quit taking the good 
things for granted Bad times tend to wake us up to the good things we werent paying attention to 

Your power exists in the now Harness it and make decisions today that will positively impact your 

tomorrows 

Congratulations on completing Step  of the Sequential Model of Professional Selling The Attitude 
Step is your springboard into the other nine steps However attitude must prevail throughout the 
Sequential Model Attitude is a prerequisite to all other steps You have now graduated to Step  
Planning and Preparation 


I close with this quote from George Bernard Shaw   

A master in the art of living knows no sharp distinction between his work and his play his labour and 
his leisure his mind and his body his education and his recreation He hardly knows which is which 
He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine 
whether he is working or playing To himself he always seems to be doing both

Chapter  Planning and Preparation Measure 
Twice Cut Once 

Overview 

The people at Training Magazine tell us that planning will become one of the most important selling 
tools of the future Planning is probably the most overlooked selling skill and yet it is the cornerstone to 
a successful relationship In proactive selling salespeople can no longer wing it by developing their plan 
on the fly The reality is that very few sales professionals actually commit the time required to 
thoroughly preplan a sales call It is far too easy to jump in the car race over to an appointment then 
anxiously await to hear what the first thing out of your mouth will be 

Customers concur that on the top of their list of selling annoyances is a lack of preparation by sales 
representatives Buyers are most annoyed by sales representatives notice I refer to sales 
representatives who show up at an appointment lacking customer knowledge and saying So what do 
you guys do here or Interesting I didnt know you guys did that A recent study suggests that  
of buyers agree that customer knowledge is a powerful selling tool but is underutilized Planning and 
customer knowledge working in harmony deliver a tremendous sales advantage Knowledge is a very 
powerful differentiator 
It is an accepted truism that humans dont plan to fail we fail to plan Why is that The reason is 
simple We are human By nature people tend to be lazysearching for the path of least resistance 
looking for a quick solution For some reason many sales representatives think they are immune to any 
precall planning Some sales representatives give new meaning to LaZBoy Although most 
salespeople have a great capability to improvise this ability cannot always carry us through a sales 
call I suppose part of the reason is that we often see ourselves as being productive simply because we 
are keeping busy As long as we are busy we must be doing good things Wrong Many salespeople 
are doers action people who prefer to start doing something instead of wasting idle time planning They 
see planning as an activity reserved for engineers accountants architects and so on 

The difference between making or not making a sale depends on several factors but the amount of 
homework done by the salesperson is a major contributing factor The more information he or she 
obtains prior to the call the higher the probability of earning the customers business Successful 
entrepreneurs see advance planning as essential to achieving success Increasing confidence using 
time effectively building credibility reducing sales cycles and differentiating themselves from the 
competition are just a few of the benefits they see As an investment planning and preparation increase 
productivity a minimum of  Think about it Imagine the outcome of a wedding or a vacation if you 
didnt take the time to plan or prepare As one sales manager says Even to successfully rob a liquor 
store you have to plan However be sure that the costs involved in precall planning dont outweigh the 
potential benefits obtained 

The corporate arena will no longer tolerate selling by the seatofthepants approach We must plan prior 
to the sales call A good carpenter knows all too well measure twice cut once Imagine the positive 
results if we did that in our personal lives and in our sales careers Interesting how there is never enough 
time to do it right the first time but there is always enough time to go back and fix it Winging it is a 
luxury that sales professionals cannot afford as it could be months or years before we get a second 
chance to do it right A No Fear Tshirt said it best Second place is the first loser Unlike the 
Olympics the sales arena doesnt offer a silver or bronze medal Just as an athlete commits to 
countless hours of training and conditioning prior to a game a sales entrepreneur must also commit to 
several hours of preparatory work

You Have Planned but Are You Prepared 

History has long confirmed that success is created by proper planning Imagine a commercial pilot 
without a flight plan a builder without blueprints a coach without a game plan or a sales entrepreneur 
without a business plan Successful sales entrepreneurs plan their work and work their plan They know 
the pitfalls of aimless activity guesswork or relying on occasional luck 
Whats the difference between planning and preparing I offer you Websters definitions as well as my 
own Websters suggests that planning is  to formulate a way to achieve or do Preparing is  to 
produce by combining elements or ingredients  to make or get ready for some purpose I augment 
Websters definitions by suggesting that planning is doing the necessary things to arrive at the 
appointment ready to do business Planning includes making the initial appointment doing your precall 
homework knowing your product developing a sales call objective and packing your briefcase with the 
appropriate tools samples and order forms As Websters says Formulate a way to achieve 
Preparation is being in a state of readiness once you arrive Good preparation ensures that you are 
ready to perform guided by a sales call objective Thus by our definition planning is stuff we do prior to 
the call and preparation is being ready to perform at the call Customer feedback consistently tells us 
that sales representatives may have indeed planned but they are seldom prepared Once sales 
representatives have secured an appointment and confirmed the address they rejoice in a false sense 
of accomplishment At best their precall planning is weak and their preparation is nonexistent 

But dont be too quick to view planning and preparation as a laborious exercise At first glance it may 
appear to be extra work but compare it to the consequences of not planning and preparing The 
consequences come in the form of longer sales cycles repeat sales calls and aimless activity Good 
planning does not increase your workload but instead helps you to work more effectively and 
productively with less physical effort You may end up with fewer appointments throughout the week 
but the time spent planning and preparing will be rewarded with higher close ratios 

Successful entrepreneurial selling demands both planning and preparation Remember your Sequential 
Model allows no missing pieces 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


What We Need to Know 

The more information we gather prior to the call the better we can plan and prepare for the call Your 
product or service may very well help the customers world move forward but initially the customer sees 
you as an intrusion an interruption It is even worse if you arrive unprepared and illequipped However 
by being prepared and ready to advance the sale your customer will be flattered by your interest and 
will begin to relax the barriers and perhaps even entertain your ideas Advanced planning allows you to 
differentiate yourself I am not suggesting that at the planning stage you learn intimate details about 
your potential customer but rather that you acquire a conversational understanding of his or her 
business Specific details come later You need to familiarize yourself with the macroissues of the 
business Planning is knowing the following pieces of information 

 
type of business its competition 
 
what it does private or public company 
 
locations current vendorhow long 
 
head office political landscape 
 
branch offices hiring or firing 
 
distribution channels organizational chart 
 
markets decision process 
 
number of employees decision maker 
 
how long in business 
Im sure there are several other issues but this list certainly guides you in the right direction Use this 
as your precall checklist Customers no longer have the time nor the patience to educate sales 
representatives 

I have personally experienced the plight of no planning With hesitation I share my story A few years 
ago I was trying to get an appointment to see Mr Ray VP of sales with a large Calgary company I was 
selling sales training Mr Ray was the decision maker bag of money and it took weeks to finally 
connect with him My persistence paid off with a  AM appointment I arrived at  AM planned and 
prepared or so I thought Ten minutes into the call Mr Ray looked me straight in the eye and asked 
So what can you tell me about my company I responded with my usual Thats why Im here to 
learn more about your operation and your specific sales training requirements Mr Ray then said 
Thats nice but what can you tell me about my company With terrifying speed I realized my 
dilemma I put down my pen and responded with a deafening Nothing Busted I didnt know a darn 
thing about his company didnt even know what they did What the heck wasnt it easier to just jump in 
the car and show up to another sales appointment Mr Ray wasnt finished He knew I was selling 
sales training so he pondered for a moment Im sure it was  minutes and then asked Sales 
training eh Can you teach my representatives to show up unprepared I thought I was going to die 
Im not sure what color my face turned but it was either red white or blue It was  in the morning 
and I was experiencing the call from hell Needless to say I was utterly embarrassed Oh the joys of 
professional selling If this situation hasnt happened to you consider yourself fortunate The customer 
hasnt tested you 

This has never happened to me again and it never will That experience proved to be one of my most 
valuable lessons of entrepreneurial selling the value of planning All I needed to satisfy Mr Rays 
question was this Your company is in the business of data management and has been since  
Your head office is in Houston and your Canadian office is in Calgary with approximately  
employees Im sure Mr Ray would have been satisfied with my conversational knowledge of his 
business and the call would have proceeded I would have earned the right to continue 

By the way after about  minutes with me doing the backstroke in Mr Rays office he finally agreed 
to evaluate our seminars by attending himself We eventually did business 

I want to make it clear at this stage that we are not out to identify our customers specific needs and 
requirements or identify how we can help them out We cant possibly learn their specific needs until we 
meet them facetoface and conduct a needs analysis by asking a series of probes Annual reports and 
company brochures do not reveal customer needs Only customers themselves can reveal their specific 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

needs Our precall planning is done to reveal only the macroissues of their business Facetoface 
dialogue with the customer is the only means available to reveal the microissues such as specific 
requirements nuances and particular needs

Where to Find It 

We live in the information age where knowledge abounds The amount of information we are bombarded 
with can be rather dauntingwe are exposed to over  pieces of information a day most of it 
useless As a sales entrepreneur we cannot afford to be wading through reams of useless information 
We need to identify and peruse sources of information that will deliver reliable informative intelligence 
about our customer These sources include 

 
the internet 
 
annual reports 
 
Dun  Bradstreet 
 
trade journals 
 
the company receptionist 
 
old files 
 
newspapers 
 
information brokers 
 
business library 
 
brochurescatalogs 
 
company newsletters 
 
industry associations 
 
other sales entrepreneurs 
 
friends in low places 
 
their sales department 
I am sure your experience will offer other avenues to gather company intelligence One of the best ways 
to gather intelligence quickly is to call the company and ask to speak directly to one of their sales 
entrepreneurs Introduce yourself tell them that you are doing some homework and ask for their help 
This is a great source of rich information often overlooked and my bet is they will be willing to 
accommodate you They are easy to reach as they are in the habit of returning phone calls I also bet 
that when they hang up they will say to themselves Hey great idea maybe I should try that approach 

The companys receptionist is another excellent source of information Receptionists are often willing to 
answer your questions and offer interesting tidbits However understand that they see a lot of 
onedimensional intrusive sales representatives come through the door so initially they may be 
reluctant to help Be professional introduce yourself and tell them why you need their help you are 
doing your homework You can also speak to someone who knows the workings of a company better 
than anybody elseit may be a foreman a supervisor a shipperreceiver or a driver These people are 
usually happy to chat with you 

The list of potential sources is endless It all depends upon your creativity and commitment to the 
relationship Ultimately your potential customer will be impressed with your knowledge It demonstrates 
an obvious respect for their time Unquestionably its a first big step in differentiating yourself and 
neutralizing your competition especially if they are hanging out at their adult daycare center being too 
busy to plan 
From time to time you may find yourself responding to unexpected inquiries where a potential customer 
has called your company This call could be triggered by wordofmouth one of your advertisements 
seeing you at a tradeshow or it may be simply an inquiry In any case your objective is to get an 
appointment Resist the temptation to sell them on the telephone Sell the appointment instead 
However during the initial telephone conversation learn as much as you can about them to ascertain 
their potential 

If there is potential sell the appointment and then do your homework prior to the call A strategy that 
has proven very effective for me when we get unexpected inquiries is to call their receptionist and ask if 
he or she would mind putting together a corporate package This may include an annual report 
brochures and other items such as a company newsletter or quarterly flyers I then send a courier to 
pick up the package within  hours of the call When I show up to the appointment knowledgeable 
about their business customers are impressed Once again its about being planned and prepared 
When is the optimum time to do your planning Im sure you answered during nonselling hours Right 
answer Dont use valuable selling hours to plan As we discuss in Chapter  ideally your planning is 
done before or after selling hours not during However sometimes selling hours provide the only 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

opportunity to call receptionists or other sales entrepreneurs Even so use your limited selling hours 
wisely 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


A State of Readiness 

With our planning complete we are now ready to prepare for the call Remember planning is stuff we 
do prior to the call whereas preparation is being ready to perform at the call A state of readiness 
begins by arriving on time which means being  to  minutes early This gives you time to mentally 
and physically prepare Preparation includes not only checking your personal hygiene fix your hair 
check yourself out look good but your corporate hygiene as well Corporate hygiene is not something 
we put much thought into It means having the appropriate tools with you to conduct business at the 
call It includes having a professional carrying case or briefcase stocked with product manuals 
company literature calculator price list professional notepad and perhaps a laptop All these 
corporate items contribute to the overall impression you make on your customer Remember the 
Sequential Model says that you are engineering customer commitment closing beginning with Step 
 Anything you do say display or not display will either enhance or erode the sale You cannot 
afford to sabotage your credibility through the use of cheap unprofessional tools that contradict your 
objectives as a sales entrepreneur Get rid of the �� Bic pen and the  notepad that 
communicates Im not really serious Sweat the details Most people cant distinguish between a 
 suit or a  one but they can see the difference between a good pen or a cheap one Dont let 
the �� Bic be your signature 

What about your personal identity package For years experts have reminded us of the tremendous 
impact image communicates Your wardrobeyour business attirespeaks volumes before you speak 
People buy you with their eyes within ten seconds Appropriate apparel and impeccable grooming 
demonstrate respect for yourself and for your customer They communicate authority and exemplify 
your commitment to perform to the high standards of a sales entrepreneur Dress violations such as 
wearing white socks with a suit a tooshort tie or having a run in your stockings can be very distracting 
to your customer Neutralize your appearance so that the focus is on you and your message Dont 
draw their attention away by wearing something that speaks louder than you You must make sure that 
nothing you say or display distracts from the call You cant aim too high in the pursuit of personal and 
corporate hygiene A winning combination of the two will certainly put you at an advantage and exceed 
the expectations of others A footnote regarding the importance of image Naked people have made little 
impression in this world Look good feel good be good 

For a sales entrepreneur the highest of personal and professional standards should prevail Planning 
and preparation will complement your commitment to excellence as the standards you set will reflect 
the rewards you get 

A true story to illustrate the importance of readiness A few years ago I had a sales representative call 
on me selling disability insurance She had made an appointment and she arrived exactly on time As 
we went through some initial pleasantries I found her likeable Her name was Betty About  to  
minutes into the call I asked Betty what disability insurance would cost for a fellow my age I was 
interested I recognized a need and I wanted more details Bettys answer was I cant give you that 
information today My computer is in the car I will have it for you next week I was a little annoyed 
However the conversation continued and she finally asked what I did I love answering that question I 
told her I facilitate professional selling skills seminars to sales professionals like herself Her jaw 
dropped and she asked Oh how am I doing Reluctantly I told her she was doing terribly Why is 
your computer in the car I asked Whats wrong with this picture Her defense was But this is my 
first call to you Im here to get to know you Thats funny I thought she was here to sell me disability 
insurance Betty seemed to think she should make a couple of social calls then sell me You see 
Betty was guilty of minimal planning and no preparation Clearly she was not prepared to do business 
She arrived at the call with little more than a predetermined wellrehearsed selling strategy that did not 
include any precall planning No flexibility I have seen it applied countless times Representatives plow 
their way through a sales call with little regard for the customers agenda I call it the cookiecutter 
sales call We eventually did business but it took her more calls than necessary to close the deal 
Betty and I became good friends and she still talks about her call from hell 
The Betty story is classic I know there are countless sales representatives out there making sales 
calls not unlike Bettyslittle planning unprepared I may be getting ahead of myself but the most 
effort you should put into closing a sale is on the first call Of course this wont happen on every 
occasion especially if you have a long sales cycle the time it takes a sale to materialize The mindset 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

of a sales entrepreneur is this Im here to sell something not just to visit and have coffee 
Every sales call including telephone sales calls must be packaged around two important aspects a 
primary agenda and a secondary agenda Your primary agenda is to sell somethingits the number 
one reason you are there Your secondary agenda is to establish rapport and build a relationshipget 
to know your customer During the call however the sequence is reversed First build rapport and trust 
make a friend then build on that trust by selling a solution that the customer buys Although being 
friendly and building relationships are important customers know that the reason for a sales call is a 
sale Each time you speak with a customer you should have a clear objectivean action you want 
taken as a result of the call You are there to do business to advance the sale Why do you think you 
were hired Your customer expects you to pursue an opportunity to do business otherwise you may be 
perceived as wasting their time By appreciating these two aspects of a call agenda you save yourself 
valuable selling time and reduce the number of wasted and unproductive sales calls Be prepared to sell 
something on the first call Dont condemn yourself to mediocrity by not planning ahead of time like my 
friend Betty 

Countless sales managers myself included have been guilty of misguiding the activities of newly hired 
salespeople They seem to forget or dont appreciate why the salesperson was hired Their instructions 
to the new salesperson are Take the next few months to simply introduce yourself to your customers 
and dont be bothering them by trying to sell something They will buy once they get to know you 
better How ridiculous What a gross violation of the companys time and money not to mention a big 
injustice to the customer Customers get irritated by calls that dont have any clear direction or provide 
an understanding of what comes next Customers are often left wondering why on earth they granted an 
appointment I thought she was going to sell me something or at least show me a new product line 

Tim Commandment  


Have clearly defined primary and secondary agenda for every sales call 
Ask What am I going to sell 


If you cannot make the sale at least sell the next step Always leave the customers office with an 
agreement a commitment for the next step It can include a breakfast meeting a plant tour a call with 
the VP of manufacturing a demonstration of your product and so on We cant afford to chew up 
valuable selling hours by making unnecessary return calls or return visits Remember studies concur 
that planning and preparation will reduce your sales cycle and increase productivity by a minimum of 
 You are running a business ME Inc Dont work hard sell smart

Time to Show Off 

The moment of truth After weeks of telephone tag voicemail and time spent planning you are finally 
facetoface with your customer You have precious little time to deal with the initial tension and create 
a positive first impression Psychological studies concur that the best approach to build rapport and 
trust is to get your customers talking about themselves or their business Its even more effective if you 
initiate the dialogue using information pertinent to their business This is where you can stimulate the 
conversation by showing off your newfound intelligence You have worked hard to obtain precall 
information about your potential customer Dont hide it Dont be shy or hesitant to show off You want 
to be subtle yet professional The following examples are effective openers when presented using an 
Oh by the way approach 

 
Congratulations on the companys th anniversary 
 
Congratulations on his or her recent promotion 
 
How is your new office in Cleveland working out 
 
I see you recently introduced a new product line 
 
I saw your new advertisement It looks great 
 
Are you still hiring 
Tie in any knowledge you have Be forthcoming Your knowledge and enthusiasm communicates to the 
customer that he or she is important and worth the time you invested in planning

Features and Benefits No Advantages 

The terms feature and benefit are commonly used within the sales profession but unfortunately 
they are often misused Sales professionals frequently interchange these terms not clear on their 
meaning Featurebenefit selling represents one of the cornerstones of professional selling It has been 
an effective strategy for centuries and I dont expect it to change not in our lifetime Its part of the 
common currency of every sales call 

To be an effective sales entrepreneur you must relate your product to the prospects unique situation 
You do this by translating your features into benefits that satisfy the customers needs It begins with an 
understanding of both features and benefits 
A feature is defined as a quality or characteristic of your product or service what it has Simple As part 
of our planning we need to recognize and appreciate the four feature categories They are the features of 

 
your industry 
 
your company 
 
your product or service 
 
you 
Each category of course offers a host of features There can be  features just about your company 
 features about your industry and so on These features combined become your corporate menu 
Its a menu of all your offerings including you which happens to be the most overlooked feature 
category When was the last time you said to a prospect And another reason you should buy from us 
is because Im your salesperson Dont sell yourself short Make a list of all your features If you are 
uncomfortable with this exercise go back to Chapter  Attitude  
A benefit is defined as what the feature does for the customer It is how a particular feature will help a 
customer and is tied directly to buying motives At the end of the day it addresses Heres how I can 
help your business Also benefits must answer the proverbial question Whats in it for me 
You may be familiar with the FAB approach of selling features advantages and benefits I have 
eliminated advantages Not required As it is sales professionals have a tough time separating features 
and benefits Lets not complicate it with an unnecessary step Few salespeople can clearly distinguish 
between advantages and benefits That being the case how would you expect your customers to 
appreciate the difference Both of you end up confused My approach is simple Customers buy only 
benefits not advantages or features For example when you buy a car the feature your hotbutton is 
power windows but the benefits are ease of operation convenience and control

Avoid the Feature Dump 

One of my favorite topics is the good old feature dump Almost all salespeople including sales 
entrepreneurs are guilty of it The feature dump is talking about what the product is how it works and 
how it compares with the competition but not what it will do for the customer Salespeople jump into a 
monologue talking ad nauseam about all the features often boring the customer to tears Believe it or 
not customers simply dont care about most of that stuff The conversation with your potential 
customers often lacks the critical connection between your product service or company and their 
needs Customers need to know how you can help improve their efficiencies or their margins or help 
them become more competitive More often than not salespeople are selling what they need to sell 
instead of selling what their customers need to buy 
Typically sales professionals show up to the call and after asking only a couple of probes begin 
spewing all their knowledge telling not selling They engage in a verbal avalanche of information 
statistics specifications and whatever else they can think of to impress the customer After all 
salespeople are supposed to be good talkers right Wrong The underlying problem is the vast amount 
of product knowledge that salespeople are exposed to Companies inundate their salespeople with 
product knowledge company policies price lists catalogs brochures flavorofthemonth promotions 
new product launches and so on Its no wonder salespeople show up and cant wait to tell the 
customer about all the features Its what they have been trained to talk about to regurgitate all the 
information in the brochure In fact a brochure is nothing more than a glossy feature dump just as a 
corporate video distributed by head office is a hightech feature dump A brochure or video cant possibly 
reflect benefits as they are very subjective It is the customers right to identify the benefits that are 
important to them Customers decide the benefits not the salespeople 
More often than not salespeople respond far too quickly when asked for a brochure They willingly send 
out or hand out their corporate brochures creating a false sense of productivity Tell your potential 
customer that you are better than a brochure and a minute appointment is necessary to explore the 
possibility of doing business 

On the lighter side rather than spend the day handing out or mailing brochures with a business card 
Just leave us your card and a brochure youd be better off to rent an airplane fly over your territory 
and shovel out  brochures It would certainly get more attention My point is this Doing an 
inperson brochuredrop does little to drive your business Brochures should be used as a leavebehind 
to augment the salenot used as a leadin However they can be an effective mailer if you highlight 
relevant features and follow up with a telephone call to make an appointment after they have received it 
This approach will sometimes impress the customer enough to grant you an appointment 
What drives the feature dump is our natural tendency to be helpful We are often seduced by a false 
sense of helpfulness created by telling the customer all about our features Sales representatives love to 
dispense information As one customer said salespeople tend to showup and throwup This 
situation reminds me of those PEZ candy dispensers we had as kids pull the head back and all this 
information comes spewing out We often get overzealous in our desire to enhance our customers 
welfare Its nothing short of blahblahblah selling inundating the customer with useless information I 
consider PEZ to be an acronym for Please Excuse my Zealousness Go out and get yourself a PEZ 
dispenser and put it on your desk as a visual reminder to banish the feature dump We must appreciate 
that our calleffectiveness is measured in terms of the customers perspective not ours 
The redundancy of a feature dump is further supported by this statistic Your customer will decide to 
buy from you based on less than  of your total features Thats it If you ask your customers why 
they bought from you their answer reveals no more than two to three reasons benefits Imagine the 
poor customer having to endure a feature dump that is  useless information to them I compare it to 
the menu analogy When you visit a restaurant you are presented with a menu The menu is nothing 
more than a list of available features You as the customer decide what features will become benefits 
As you are handed your menu your server might as well say Here is our list of features Ill be back in 
a few minutes to take your list of benefits After reviewing the menu which can easily include  or 
more features you place your order of only four to five benefits Theres your  The rest of the items 
remain as features The only person who can decide on the benefits is your customer Your customer is 
the ultimate authority to either accept or reject your features as benefits There lies the challenge 
Identify the features on your corporate menu that will benefit your customer 

Feature Dumpers Syndrome is an undetected virus that has plagued salespeople for centuries It 
sabotages more sales calls than any other sales virus 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

The common feature dump virus quietly goes about its business disguising itself as a routine 
predictable component of a typical sales call If you dont think you are a feature dumper just ask your 
customers 

Unfortunately there are no pills antibiotics or prescriptions available to cure this unproductive approach 
to selling But dont fret help is here at last The cure lies in your willingness and commitment to 
embrace a sales entrepreneurial code of conduct Its time to do more selling and less telling features 
tell benefits sell 

The feature dump is not something we can totally eliminate From time to time you will find yourself 
engaged in an elaborate monologue spewing out sowhat information If you find yourself in this 
situation the best thing to do is finish your thought pause for a moment and say Well thats enough 
about me how about telling me more about you Invite the customer to talk about his or her business 
by asking conversational probes Resist the temptation to revert back to a feature dump Take notes 
and truly listen to what your customer is telling you 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Two Types of Information 

One of the deadliest traps of a sales call is predictability the mark of a boring ordertaker selling on 
price versus value Customers have been conditioned over the years to anticipate a boring predictable 
sales callthe kind where a representative shows up and dispenses a wellrehearsed pitch Sometimes 
customers themselves open the call by saying Okay lets hear your pitch or Tell me about your 
company In fact customers often communicate their displeasure with the these routine sales calls by 
not granting second appointments The first appointment must be worthwhile or you can forget about a 
second appointment Some customers go as far as to say Okay come in but youve only got  
minutes That is simply a way to shield themselves from another lengthy feature dump 


What should you do if your customer looks at his watch and says that youve only got five minutes 
Believe me it happens Sadly enough the majority of salespeople take that as an invitation to recite the 
Cliffs Notes version of their pitch If you answered Id tell him all about our company and what we do 
you may want to reconsider your approach Avoid the overwhelming temptation to feature dump During 
the first few seconds acknowledge the limited time frame and suggest youll be finished in four and a 
half minutes Then give the customer a second infomercial as to who you are and what you do 
highlighting the distinctive benefits that may be of interest Then ask permission to ask a few questions 
to learn more about their business to explore if there is a possible fit During your probing the customer 
will clearly see your sincerity and obvious interest Take the last  seconds to acknowledge your time 
is up and reschedule another appointment I suggest that the vast majority of the time the customer will 
be impressed with your obvious interest and extend the appointment by saying Its okay please 
continue Remember if customers feel you may be able to help their business or alleviate an existing 
inconvenience they are interested Your fiveminute appointment will often turn into a onehour 
conversation 

During the sales call it is the type of information being dispensed by the salesperson that labels the call 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

as routine and boring or interesting and worthwhile for the customer There are two types of information 
First there is what I call sowhat information usually associated with sales representatives Its the 
classic feature dump where the representative is working through a wellrehearsed enthusiastic pitch 
about all the features but generating a sowhat reaction from the customer Even the sales 
representative gets bored with it 
The second type of information is Heres how I can help your business usually associated with a 
sales entrepreneur Surprisingly this approach is a refreshing change for your customer It breaks the 
typical mold of a sales call and brings something new to the table a genuine interest in the customer 
Of course this type of information just doesnt happen Its the result of effective planning preparation 
and smart probing Once you have identified relevant features via probing bridge them to the 
corresponding benefits We have more on bridging and probing in Chapter  
I offer a statistic that should surprise you Your competitor can offer approximately  of the same 
features you can I call it the duplication factor Why do you think they are called competitors Because 
they duplicate many of the same things you do maybe even better To compete they mirror several of 
the same features you offer The key is to differentiate yourself emphasizing that the business 
advantage your company can offer is you Your competitors dont have you Anyone can copy and 
improve a product or service match a competitors features copy their sales promotions or undercut 
prices but they cant copy or duplicate you Apply your own unique style your own signature to your 
Sequential Model Remember customers are looking to buy relationships peace of mind not just 
products 

I dont mean to suggest that product knowledge is not important Of course it is I agree that you must 
know what you are talking about in terms of specifications technical applications manufacturing 
specifications industry standards and your competitors offerings Learn as much about your 
competitors as you can Make it part of your planning However although this information is important 
it wont close a sale for you Remember only  of the decision to buy from you is based on your 
product knowledge 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Account Classification Three Types 

Managing your account base is often a question of maintaining existing customers and finding new 
customers who are most likely to buy then engaging your resources to maximize the opportunity 
However some accounts are more profitable than others and lets face it profit drives your business 
You must maximize your returns by satisfying the greatest number of profitable customers Return can 
be measured in a number of ways ROI return on investmentthe amount of money and time spent on 
an account ROE return on energyenergy expended to secure the account ROO return on 
occasionleads or referrals you get while golfing or participating at an occasion outside normal selling 
activities or selling hours ROO extends your limited selling hours and ROT return on your time equity 
asks how wisely are you spending your allotted time 

Not all customers have the same buying potential The portion of unprofitable accounts is usually 
greater than you think I remind you of the  rule  of your sales come from only  of your 
customers Therefore sales entrepreneurs need to classify customers on the basis of their sales 
potential to avoid spending too much time with lowpotential accounts Remember there are only  
selling hours in one entire year We cant afford to be busy servicing unproductive unprofitable 
accounts Dont be fooled by revenue numbers Revenue alone doesnt keep a business afloat profits 
do Pricing your product or service at or below cost is not smart business but many sales 
representatives are seduced into a quick sale where profit is sacrificed for revenue Your business must 
be managed by utilizing all of the resources at your disposal maximizing your return in the most 
productive manner To that end I offer a very simple account classification strategy the ABC analysis 
Its not new but it certainly works Use this method to evaluate and classify each of your existing and 
potential accounts 

A Accounts 

Your A accounts deserve the most attention Heres why 

 
They have high potential return ROIROEROOROT 
 
They require minimum invested time 
 
They are low maintenance 
 
They are cooperative if problems arise 
 
They have a high contribution based on marginsprofit 
 
They have a short sales cycle 
B Accounts 

B accounts are not quite as attractive as your As but certainly worth pursuing Heres why 

 
They have good potential return ROIROEROOROT 
 
They require a high amount of invested time 
 
They have higher maintenance 
 
They are patient with problems 
 
They have a good contribution based on marginsprofit 
 
They have a longer sales cycle 
C Accounts 

I fondly refer to a C account as a pain in the asset C accounts usually distract you from your A and B 
accounts offering little or no return for your investment Heres why 

 
They offer lowno potential return ROIROEROOROT 
 
They require an excessive amount of time 
 
They are high maintenance lots of babysitting 
 
They are impatient when problems arise 
 
They provide minimal contribution based on low or no marginsprofits 
 
They have very long sales cycle 
These accounts are literally a pain They whine about this and that finding the darndest things to 
complain about In spite of your efforts they are never satisfied 

As you classify your accounts I strongly recommend you continue to work closely with your As and 
Bs and toss your Cs Thats right get rid of them With limited selling hours you cant possibly 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

maintain C accounts as well as service your As and Bs Remember C accounts are a major distraction 
to your core business accounts By responding to or pursuing C accounts your AB accounts could 
inadvertently become a silver platter opportunity for your competitor In most cases the neglect is 
unintentional but the consequences can be dire This is a chief cause of lost customers 

However be aware of potential changes in account status A C account today may become an A 
account tomorrow Likewise a B today may become a C tomorrow and so on There is no universal 
grading system An A or B account in your territory could well be a C in another territory Each territory 
has its own unique account classification parameters 

Here is a fact that may help guide your thinking as you manage and grow your account base It costs 
your employer approximately  to  for every sales call you make based on approximately one 
hour of actual selling time Now lets add  for the customers time and we have a  sales call 
Not many salespeople think in terms of cost per sales call but as an entrepreneur you must ask 
yourself Is this call worth  It becomes clear that time with a C account is not only unproductive 
but very costly 

Once you have determined that an account has a C status dont be too quick to abandon it Four 
options are available 

 
Use them to practice Where do most salespeople practice and refine their sales 
skills Usually when they are sitting before an A or B customer Not a good plan 
Practice the steps of your Sequential Model at a C account Its a winwin situation If 
you screw up the customer wont want to do business with you anyway The big win 
is that you took a step closer to refining and polishing your skills in a lowrisk 
situation Practice makes permanentno different than a professional golfer hitting 
hundreds of balls at the driving range A C account is to a sales entrepreneur what a 
flight simulator is to a pilot developing a new skill 
 
Double their price I dont necessarily mean literally double it but certainly a price 
increase may be appropriate Visit or call your C accounts with their revised pricing in 
your hot little hand No doubt their reaction will be Look at this you increased my 
price Your response is Yes I know The revised price represents the lowest point 
at which you will do business with them Its your line in the sand Anything lower and 
you are simply not interested The upside can be rewarding If they accept your 
revised price you now have a B or an A account It is surprising how often they 
accept the revised pricingand if they do be sure to nurture them to a solid B or 
possibly an A account 
Another response you may hear from a C account is I can buy it cheaper elsewhere That 
could very well be true and the natural tendency of a sales representative is to reduce the 
price until the customer agrees to buy However if the customer is unhappy with your lowest 
pricepoint I suggest you use Lee Iaccocas line If you feel you can get a better deal 
elsewhere then buy it It communicates confidence in yourself and your proposal and quite 
often customers will reevaluate their decision Customers today appreciate the old adage 
You get what you pay for 

 
Clean deal Logic tells us that with limited selling hours we simply cant extend your 
C customers the luxury of a personal sales call Explain to them that their situation 
does not justify or warrant a personal visit You will no longer make the onehour trek 
to visit them Its simply not a good validation of your  selling hours Inform your 
customer that you are prepared to sell to them but without direct representation 
However the condition of doing business is that you redefine the rules of 
engagement These would include pricing a delivery schedule minimum order 
quantities and payment terms 
Once both parties understand the new arrangement invite them to place orders with your 
order desk or inside representative Or they may want to send you an email order or leave a 
voice mail This approach can be effective and represents a clean deal for both you and your 
customers Also it can be an additional revenue stream that contributes to your monthly 
quarterly or annual targets 

 
Fire them During my years of selling I have never seen a concept so openly 
embraced by the business community Fire C accounts Companies are no longer 
tolerant of the aggravations and frustrations C accounts bring Case in point I 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

recently called on one of my national accounts and asked how his morning was 
going He said this I spent the morning deciding which accounts to fire This 
comment echoes the sentiments of corporate executives Sales managers have 
typically challenged salespeople to close every possible account within their territory 
They constantly ask Are we doing business there and if not why not Managers 
should now be asking Why are we doing business there I encourage sales 
managers to challenge their salespeopleask them to validate with sound 
justification why an account is doing business with them Just because an account 
resides in your territory doesnt mean you have to come hither to their beckoning call 
You can pick and choose who qualifies to do business with you Establish the 
parameters for your A and B accounts and know what parameters flag a C account I 
recently made a sales call and the manager I was visiting had an interesting analogy 
The company was in the process of demarketing its account base It was 
eliminating the Cs and focusing on its As and Bs 


Firing an account doesnt mean pursuing an unprofessional unceremonious approach It means 
engaging in an open honest dialogue with your customer It could be as simple as saying Although 
we have both explored the possibility of doing business together it appears at this time we cannot move 
forward I do thank you for considering usYou then suggest the customer research the market for other 
options Appreciating how valuable your time is your choice is simple You can choose to work more 
and make less or work less and make more 
Another aspect to consider is to evaluate each opportunity within existing accounts Evaluate and 
classify each opportunity based on its own merit Dont throw out the baby with the bath water For 
example you may be presented with a C opportunity within an A account Your options are to fulfil the 
C opportunity in the interest of the relationship or to politely decline by explaining your reasons and 
perhaps suggesting an alternative An effective strategy is when you and your customer agree to 
disagree Rather than aggravating your customer by walking away from a C opportunity its preferable to 
openly discuss your reasons Come to an agreement and that may be to disagree all the while keeping 
the relationship intact 

Parameters that flag a C account or C opportunities are as varied as customers themselves Typical 
reasons include poor returns they insist on a rockbottom price they are too demanding you are 
unable to fulfil expectations or they order lowerthanacceptable volumes However you may elect to 
pursue them for corporate or political reasons as the Head Office may deem the account prestigious or 
strategic to the businessone that looks great on the corporate r��sum��

Chapter  Time Management Its About Time 

A mentor of mine once told me People make time for things they want to do If someone doesnt want 
to participate it aint gonna happen Back to the dynamics of motivation Only you can light a fire within  
Chapter  We must take responsibility for ourselves and our actions and use SMART goals to 
stimulate motivation Motivation is the difference between being proactive and in control or being 
reactive out of control Become the author of your activities and your success Make things happen 
rather than just reacting to events as they occur The choice is simple Either manage time and invest it 
wisely or time will control you 

But I Dont Have Time 

How often have you wished for only a few more hours in your day How many times have you 
searched for a magic answer a quick fix to relieve the pressures of time If you are like most of us the 
answer is frequently We live in an environment of unfinished tasks halfdone sales plans incomplete 
reports unread books and endless personal chores There is no question that the majority of us are 
timestarved always running just a bit behind Would a hour day help I doubt it It would just add 
six more hours of accumulated stress and frustration to our lives Lets do a better job of managing the 
time we have 
In Chapter  you learned about five attitudinal characteristics of sales entrepreneurs and the impact 
those characteristics have on performance personally and professionally This attitudinal package 
including time managementforms the backbone of the skills discussed throughout the model Within 
the Sequential Model however time management is not a step on its own although I do feel the 
subject is worthy of a chapter 

On the wishlist of salespeoples training topics time management continues to dominate as if there 
exists a magic answer a quick fix to exonerate them from the necessary discipline required to be 
organized the discomfort of discipline Once again we tend to search for the easy way the path of least 
resistance The quick fix is available but not in pill form not yet It comes in the form of commitment 
and desire coupled with the attitudinal package discussed in Step  of the sequential model 
The first step on the road to recovery is to recognize that you are the one primarily responsible for your 
own time problems and frustrations Dont continue to rely on a plethora of wellrehearsed excuses to 
bail you out The next step is to truly have the desire and the commitment to invest whatever is 
necessary to become organized Without these ingredients time management will continue to be a 
laborious exercise in futility and frustration robbing you of your full potential 
By the way you do have enough time

Time Equity Whats Your ROT 

Time is a unique unrenewable resource It marches onward at a rate of  minutes every hour It shows 
no favoritism No one is immune to the relentless unforgiving passage of time Consider this two days 
from now tomorrow will be yesterday Or how about this two days ago yesterday was tomorrow 
Confused Read it again youll see Warning dates on the calendar are closer than they appear 

In todays competitive environment workloads have become swollen by increasingly leaner and meaner 
companies There are fewer positions on company organizational charts and the average workload of 
those who remain has been growing Salespeople now have to spend more time in the office distracted 
from selling by fulfilling administrative obligations You must appreciate that companies today pay for 
results not the number of hours you work Companies no longer reward busyness In many cases 
working long hours a  or hour week is simply a smoke screen concealing inefficiencies and poor 
work habits Nothing is easier than being busy and few things are more difficult than being efficient and 
effective It requires discipline Imagine having the time to get your work done leaving the office at a 
reasonable hour and spending the rest of your day with family or friends Its possible read on 
The one universal distribution of equity is time Everybody on the planet has ownership of  hours per 
day We all receive the same allotment day in and day out Each new day brings an automatic deposit 
of  hours into our time account I refer to it as time equity Although each day brings a new deposit 
each day the entire amount must be withdrawn with no balance carried over to tomorrow Use it or lose 
it The challenge we face is how and where to invest our time equity These decisions determine 
success career path productivity and family status The truth is that where we are in life is a direct 
reflection of how well we have managed our time portfoliohow and where we spent our time We 
often hear people refer to personal activities in terms of time equity How did you spend your 
weekend or During our trip we spent a lot of time doing  Time equity is the essence of a full and 
complete life We often take it for granted and succumb to its harsh unforgiving consequences We 
have to take responsibility for ourselves and consciously appreciate the positive impact time 
management can have on our lives 
Anyone who expects to achieve sales success should expect to make a serious commitment to 
working hard and efficiently Throughout the five principles of time management that follow I share 
various techniques and suggestions to help streamline your activities Remember we discussed balance 
in Chapter  Think of your activities in terms of quality and quantity Balance means quality time versus 
quantity time Many people spend quantity time in the office but not quality time

Five Principles of Time Management 

Time cannot think for you but it can certainly work for you Like any other investment time produces 
returns if invested wisely and treated with respect Sales professionals constantly explore investment 
opportunities for their time maximizing their ROT 

Principle  Maximize Your ROT 

Spending your time wisely starts with paying attention to how you spend it Only when you decide to 
take control of your time will you have the power to stop squandering it The best starting point to a 
better ROT is to conduct your own timeefficiency study Evaluate your current use of time by breaking 
down a typical day into hourly increments Be objective Include everything throughout your entire day 
even the time you sleep You may need to track a full week or two to get a clear picture of your time 
usage The tape recorder you purchased after reading Chapter  might be a convenient method to log 
your time It wont take long for patterns or habits to emerge Some will be painfully obvious and youll 
need no encouragement to change We improve our ROT only by recognizing how we spend our time 
The next step is to review your time log and classify the activities as timewasters obligations or 
priorities Timewasters are just that activities that distract you and contribute nothing toward your 
goals Eliminate them The danger is that timewasters are activities performed out of habit Usually 
they create a false sense of productivity but actually produce few or no results The cure comes in the 
form of personal organization the process of incorporating structure into your day 
Obligations are the dutiful responsibilities of your job They are necessary yet unimportant activities 
usually performed throughout the day They contribute indirectly to your goals They are the 
administrative aspects of your job such as call reports expense reports quarterly forecasts and 
various other required duties Despite the challenges of limited time coupled with increased 
responsibilities you can be productive by evaluating your current usage of your  hours and 
maximizing ROT Obligations cannot be overlooked but be cognizant of the negative impact they have 
on daily productivity As you become better organized you can streamline your activities minimizing the 
time spent fulfilling obligations You may be in a position to delegate some of your administrative duties 
to support people internal customers within your office I know of some sales entrepreneurs who have 
hired a parttime assistant Maximize your ROT by doing what you do best selling 
Priorities are the activities that contribute significantly to your ROT They are directly responsible for 
your results moving you closer to your goals Remember companies today pay for results not 
activities They no longer pay for attendence they expect results 
As you evaluate your current use of time the timewasters will become clear allowing you to rethink 
your activities Make the shift from a long day filled with unproductive busyness to a shorter day 
focusing on priorities As a sales entrepreneur challenge yourself to be more proactive by prioritizing 
your tasks Take control of the activities that prey on your efficiency compromising your ROT Once 
you complete your timeefficiency study you will be shocked to see the time wasted reacting to other 
peoples demands and requests Most of us habitually spend our days reacting instead of being 
proactive unaware of the costly consequence I suggest that up to  of our day is reactive A 
sobering thought 

Principle  Know What Time It Is 

If you are like most salespeople you have too much to do and not enough time to get it all done To get 
ahead in todays fastpaced world youve got to be aware of what time it is Im not talking about telling 
time you learned that years ago What Im talking about is Its not enough that youre doing a particular 
job right youve got to be sure that youre doing the right activity at the right time By the way if you 
dont have a good watch get one The best and simplest time management tool is on your wrist 
Common sense tells us that we should spend the majority of our time working on highpriority A and B 
accounts Most of us dont We waste a lot of time in the adult daycare center reacting to the demands 
of C accounts or even performing C activities The first step is to take control of your entire day by 
knowing what time it is

Selling Hours or Janitorial Hours 

A full year gives us time equity of  hours The use of these hours is a personal choice under our 
direct control However one thing we cannot control is the number of available selling hours in a year 
There are approximately  selling hours in one entire year Thats all A rather sobering statistic 
Heres the math Your customers work approximately eight hours a day and there are approximately 
 selling days per year  x    The  selling days is the number of business days minus 
weekends holidays and wasted time throughout the year including travel time and doing personal 
chores during the business day These numbers may vary depending upon industry but for the sake of 
discussion I use  
During valuable selling hours you must organize yourself to maximize facetime or talktime Dont 
perform administrative obligations during selling time Do those activities during the janitorial hours 
outside the  AM to  PM selling hours Having worked with large and small companies Ive often 
witnessed salespeople who dont appreciate what time it is I see them in the adult daycare center 
during the day doing their expense reports or call reports updating customer files and performing 
general administrative obligations There are approximately  janitorial hours in a year the time 
available to perform your administrative tasks Successful sales entrepreneurs know that selling is not 
an  AM to  PM job They carefully plan their days to maximize selling time and use the afterhours 
time to complete administrative activities So next time youre thinking of getting your hair cut getting 
the car washed or doing your expense report during selling hours refer to Tim Commandment  Page 

 
Principle  Manage Your Time 

Time management is a personal process It takes a strong commitment to change longestablished 
habits According to the  rule we get  of our results from  of the things we do This 
statistic supports the observation that we spend a lot of time on timewasters and obligations Imagine 
the impact on our time efficiency if we increased the  to  

What takes us from a timestarved day of routine frustration and stress to a productive day filled with 
accomplishments Change One definition of time management is doing fewer things in less time 
Wouldnt that be great 
Research suggests that effective time management strategies can free up a minimum of two hours per 
day For example time management studies show that we spend up to  minutes a day just looking 
for stuff  How many times have you said Just a minute I know its here somewhere We misplace 
files reports memos and letters and our desks look like the movie Twister was filmed in our office 
Clutter can be a huge timewaster not to mention the embarrassment of lost or unanswered requests 
Your goal isnt to have a nice neat desk but to get organized so that you can convert wasted time into 
productive time However with a clean orderly desk youll improve your time working on priorities that 
will make you money Your quality of work will also improve 
The underlying objective of effective time management is to utilize all available resources to increase 
facetime the time spent talking facetoface with existing customers or potential customers If youre 
an inside salesperson increase talktime Take some time to determine how much time you actually 
spend with customers Take a stop watch and clock total facetime in one entire week On average its 
only two to four hours  Shocking This statistic serves as additional proof of the inordinate amount of 
time consumed by timewasters and obligations I recognize that with leaner companies salespeople 
are often saddled with more of the administrative aspects of the job Unfortunately they become 
highpriced administrators This brings us to Tim Commandment  

Tim Commandment  
Manage your time equity 
Ask Is this activity the best use of my time right now 
How many times a day should you ask yourself if you are making the best use of your time If you 
answered several youre right Only you can answer that question honestly As the president of ME

Inc dont compromise your ROT by blindly filling your day with busyness Restructure your day to 
eliminate the timewasters and minimize the time spent fulfilling obligations Sometimes working in the 
office on a project or on a presentation could very well be the best use of your time I doubt that you can 
ever eliminate time spent in the adult daycare center but you certainly need to minimize it Use 
janitorial time to fulfil your obligations 
As part of your timeefficiency study you should determine the time of day that you are most efficient 
and productive Know your peak time the time of day you are at high energy Not everyone has the 
same peak time Some of us are morning people and others are afternoon or evening people Pay 
attention to your moods and highenergy time of day to determine when youre most productive Morning 
people can accomplish more simply by getting up an hour earlier each day and night owls can carve 
out time for administrative activities in the evenings 

Once you have identified your peak time do your worst jobs then They wont go away so you might as 
well get them done when youre feeling energized Some authors suggest doing them first thing in the 
morning when youre feeling fresh This approach works well if youre a morning person but could be 
disastrous if youre an afternoon person Imagine doing your worst job at your worst time of day Two 
worsts dont make a right In my case prime time is during the late afternoon and early evening I 
prefer to schedule important meetings or presentations later in the day anytime after  PM I did most 
of my writing for this book between  PM and  PM 
Another suggestion in the interest of maximizing your ROT is to learn how to say no Many of us are 
our own worst enemies Youll never have enough time to finish your own tasks if youre always taking 
on more than time permits Dont be afraid to politely refuse a request or task if your plate is already full 
This includes saying no to your sales manager When given a task simply ask your manager Would 
you like me to do this now or would you prefer I spend the time selling Your manager may decide to 
delegate the task elsewhere Its great to want to help others but not at the expense of ME Inc 

Principle  Use the Right Tools 

A professional sales entrepreneurs included is anyone paid to perform a task or a job at an acceptable 
level of proficiency while utilizing the tools of the trade to enhance efficiency and effectiveness I am 
amazed at how often I see salespeople conducting business with inappropriate tools Its as though 
theyre exempt from the requirement to be a professional Imagine your doctor or dentist using anything 
but the best instruments Your customers expect no less of you As a sales entrepreneur you have an 
obligation to invest in the best You may have heard it before A carpenter is only as good as his tools 

The solution begins with a personal plannera time management system that offers the convenience of 
portability while organizing your activities mapping your week and most importantly planning your day 
A good planner includes twelve months ataglance  individual daypages a daily todo list section 
and an appointments section Some planners come with a rigid set of instructions so pick a planner 
that offers simplicity and the flexibility to meet your personal preferences 

A planner used effectively not only buys you time it helps you stay in balance throughout your week 
including weekends Poor time management skills result in overspending your time running out of day 
before you get everything done I compare it to managing a checking account Imagine opening a 
checking account at your local bank then not using a checkbook to track the account activity Surely 
you would find yourself out of balance at the end of the month possibly overspending your available 
funds Without the appropriate tool to track your timerelated activities you quickly find yourself out of 
balance overdrawn on your time account

Sales Automation 

Whats the best time management tool for the sales entrepreneur the almighty computer or the 
personal planner The debate continues I have witnessed and have been a part of many lively 
discussions weighing legitimate pros and cons of the laptop computer as a time management tool 
My position is this Computers are great for certain tasks but time management isnt one of them In 
spite of all our wonderful technologies it appears that the good old pencil and paper system is still 
viable More and more professionals who were initially romanced by time management software 
programs are returning to the convenience simplicity and portability of the personal planner Im not 
suggesting people are littering our highways with abandoned laptops but they are learning to work in 
harmony with a laptop or a palm pilot and pencil and paper The ideal system seems to be a 
combination Its no longer an eitheror decision Dont compromise your productivity by restricting 
yourself to only one system Incorporate the tools that work best for you maximizing your limited 
selling hours Caution Don��t get overly seduced by technology and look like some sort of technological 
rambo KISS 

Bear in mind that my comments are directed at outside salespeople I appreciate that a 
computerbased time management program may be appropriate for inside salespeople while a portable 
timemanagement system may be redundant However you may want to consider a smaller version of a 
personal planner or a palm pilot to organize your activities outside the office 

As a sales entrepreneur your computer should be viewed as a portable database allowing you to work 
in the field and access or update customer files utilizing a good contact management program This 
allows you to retrieve important information prior to your appointment including current account data 
inventory levels at the warehouse available shipping dates price levels and data specific to your 
customer You can also store and retrieve such pieces of information as the name of your customers 
spouse and children dates of their birthdays and anniversaries hobbies outside interests and favorite 
summer activities You decide what data are relevant There are several good contact management 
programs available I prefer Maximizer and ACT because both programs offer a host of features to 
manage your account base saving valuable selling time 

The computer can be a great asset when utilized outside the customers office but it can become a 
liability in the customers office Sometimes a laptop just isnt convenient and may even be 
cumbersome intrusive and timeconsuming Laptops should be used in a customers office only with 
permission whereas you dont need permission to work with a planner The big plus of a planner is that 
its quick convenient portable and useable anytime anywhere 

Principle  Be Proactive not Reactive 

I would suggest that up to  of our day is spent reacting to the needs and requests of other people 
such as customers managers internal customers family and friends We are constantly bombarded 
with demands on our limited time leaving us unable to accomplish our own goals and objectives No 
wonder we feel the frustration of So much to do so little time 
We often succumb to the demands and requests of others because we think it is socially inappropriate 
to say no We become victimized by others who may have a strong interest in controlling our activities 
or behaviorsuch as a spouse or a manager Unfortunately many people including salespeople are 
content to be regulated and manipulated rather than committing to SMART goals and living life guided 
by their agenda not someone elses No one ever accomplished a personal goal by being subservient to 
others Successful sales entrepreneurs refuse to be swayed by the whims of others and are quietly 
effective at managing their own agendas Employers and managers sometimes do more to demotivate 
rather than to motivate Demotivation can take the form of intimidation or highperformance expectations 
constrained by rigid management policies and limited resources to perform the job No wonder so many 
people want to take this job and shove it 

A proactive strategy means developing the discipline to stay focused on your agenda your goals and 
your objectives Part of this discipline comes in the form of qualifying the severity of a problem prior to 
reacting to it For example next time a customer informs you of a problem or a concern resist the 
temptation to immediately jump into react mode drop what you are doing and race over to console 
your customer It may not be necessary The next time you get an irate customer or internal customer 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

demanding to see you right away follow these two steps 

 
Acknowledge the problem Allow the customer to vent by explaining the situation 
and then clarify your understanding of it by paraphrasing Be sure to take notes of 
your discussion for future reference By acknowledging the concern and showing 
empathy the customer will begin to feel better about it and may become somewhat 
flexible as to how and when you resolve the concern A sympathetic attitude to a real 
or imaginary product or service failure cannot be overemphasized A minute phone 
call to determine the facts and the seriousness of the problem may be a valuable 
investment possibly saving you hours of unnecessary running around Work smart 
not hard 
 
Suggest another time Tell the customer that your day is full with appointments and 
commitments and ask if first thing tomorrow morning would be okay to get together 
Your business and time are just as important and legitimate as that of your 
customer You are equals In the majority of cases your customer will appreciate 
your schedule and agree to meet with you the next day Too often we assume that 
we must respond immediately but by following these steps you will save yourself 
valuable time Sometimes however the customer may be insistent that you respond 
immediately in which case you must act accordingly 
Another good tactic is to start building flexibility into your day By this I mean schedule your day to 
allow for poop happens Allow time between appointments or activities to deal with interruptions that 
are sure to occur Interruptions and problems are a natural component of everybodys day so dont 
ignore the fact that they happen and plan accordingly Dont try to pack too much into one day by 
scheduling consecutive appointments and meetings Plan what you can reasonably expect to get 
accomplished that day and allow time to deal with inevitable interruptions I suggest that you let the 
 rule be your guide dont plan more than  of your day The remaining  is reserved to deal 
with unforeseen yet inevitable interruptions It also helps prevent the listlayover syndrome where we put 
unfinished todo items onto tomorrows schedule If your workday is ten hours dont plan for more than 
six hours Once again if you pack too much into a day you will surely have to make rigorous cuts deal 
with unfinished tasks and wrestle with unnecessary stress Remember one of the aspects of a 
SMART goal is attainable Make your daily activities attainable

If Youre on Time Youre Late 

This concept needs to be taken literally Punctuality is certainly one of several prerequisites to a 
successful meeting but it doesnt seem to be taken very seriously Many salespeople arrive at 
appointments with barely  seconds to spare before sitting before a potential A or B opportunity Not a 
wise thing to do We are all timestarved but dont compensate for it at the expense of shortchanging 
mental preparation time If you have a  AM meeting be there no later than  Dont come flying 
in at  out of breath and still dealing with road rage You need those few minutes to mentally 
prepare for the meeting Although you are there physically you are not there mentally You may even 
want to take a few minutes in the washroom to give yourself a final check before the meeting 

Dont be late Customers accept very few excuses for tardinessbad weather doesnt cut it I once 
overheard a sales manager quip to a rep who was  minutes late for a meeting There are only two  
oclocks in the day How can you screw it up If you are unavoidably late even by one minute call 
ahead to inform the customer of the situation Its very professional and its appreciated

Embrace Stress A Timely Suggestion 

One of the biggest most transparent timewasters is stress When we experience stress it can 
handicap our performance and distract us We typically experience a low energy level Stress intrudes 
on our time efficiency and reduces our level of productivity To some extent stress is inevitable and 
beyond our control but how we handle it is well within our control A fiveyear study published by the 
Families and Work Institute showed that growing demands at work are creating problems at home for 
timestarved employees They end up feeling too stressed to work efficiently Growing pressures on 
employees often negatively affect home lives and in turn work lives The study goes on to say that a 
high percentage of employees always feel they dont have enough time for their families or other 
important people in their lives because of their jobs and  sometimes feel that way  A recent 
survey by KPMG found that  of the  respondents were ambivalent about their current jobs 
whereas only  were very satisfied No question that this level of indifference creates stress and an 
attitude of frustration For many stress is a cause of deteriorating health decreased productivity and 
poor time management The way I see it is some people show up to work dealing with sleep rage andor 
road rage and then go home frustrated by job rageand then more road rage What a day Consider 
this what tires most in life is not what we are doing but the thought of what we havent done yet 
So what is stress Stress is our response to various events or situations stress is a reaction The 
cause or stressor is neutral Stress is often viewed as the enemy a debilitating virus that cripples our 
productivity and unknowingly robs us of our precious timeequity Stress has negative connotations 
Libraries and bookstores are full of stress management strategies However stress can be positive too 
Stress may be the high level of anxiety we feel during a change in our lives or it may be the keen sense 
of concentration we experience when faced with an exciting new challenge out of our comfort zone 

Stress is a great motivator We can be motivated toward something positive stress or motivated away 
from something negative stress Positive stress keeps us focused motivated energized and 
challenged It can have tremendous impact on the efficient use of our allotted timeequity Positive 
stress can enhance our performance at work and at home When faced with a stressor we need to 
remember that we can control our response We have the responseability to transform the reaction 
into a response that is positive We also have the responseability to lower our stress tolerance In his 
book Dont Sweat the Small Stuff  and Its All Small Stuff Dr Richard Carlson says that Our stress 
level will be exactly that of our tolerance to stress In other words people who say I can handle lots of 
stress will always be under a great deal of it Its no surprise then that people continue to take on new 
things until they max out their stress level Carlson suggests the solution is to reduce our tolerance to 
stress He goes on to say When youre feeling out of control and resentful of all you have to do a good 
strategy is to relax take a few deep breaths and take a break He suggests reorganizing your day and 
not worrying that you wont get it all done When your mind is clear and peaceful and your stress level 
is reduced youll be more effective and youll have more fun  I agree I suggest you lower your stress 
tolerance by exercising one of the  Ds do it delegate it or dump it Learn how to say no Stop taking 
on more than you are physically or mentally able to handle If you find yourself overwhelmed and who 
hasnt break down your projects into smaller manageable parts then assign yourself SMART goals 
with deadlines Most tasks can be broken down into smaller parts thus eliminating the need to commit 
to a huge uninterrupted chunk of time As you may have heard How do you eat an elephant One bite 
at a time So make your time management motto this Inch by inch anythings a cinch 

Another way to help you put more control and less stress back into your life is to follow these four 
sequential steps 

 
Identify the source What is causing the stress what are the stressors Examine 
your environments both work and play and isolate potential stressors Explore all 
areas of your life 
 
Recognize the symptoms What symptoms are you experiencing because of the 
stress losing weight gaining weight drinking or smoking more general poor health 
Everybody reacts differently to stress Know your body and how it reacts 
 
Create solutions What can you change what can you do differently You are in full 
control of initiating change Other than death taxes and who your parents and siblings 
are you can change almost anything You have full control over your destinyno one 
else does If you dont like your job change it Dont like the city you live in Change it 
Dont like your level of education Change it 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

 
Set SMART goals What is your action plan for change Set a course of action that 
will eventually bring about change It wont happen overnight Distractions can be a 
major deterrent to getting things done Identify what is distracting and find ways to 
eliminate it No question that stress continues to be a virus that robs us of valuable 
facetime with potential customers My overall suggestion is to identify your stressor 
and get rid of it Sure easier said than donebut get off your butt and JUST DID IT

Lets Do Lunch Meal Protocol 

Next time you say Lets do lunch you may want to consider how it relates to your ROT Effective 
time management is a discipline that must be practiced every day all dayincluding meals The three 
meals of the day offer an excellent opportunity to extend your selling hours and possibly increase your 
productivity 

With an eye to that end I offer you these guidelines on meal protocol and maximizing your meal time 
with customers 
Breakfast A great way to begin the day with a potential or existing customer Meet at  or  AM 
at a spot conveniently located close to their office The dialogue should be  business  social 
You are there to sell the customer and through open conversation discover how to earn their business 
Your agenda is I want your business how do I go about earning it Dont be afraid to express your 
intentions The conversation will quickly move to business and they expect you to be asking questions 
Breakfast is quick its cheap and it provides excellent oneonone time with your customer It offers a 
more relaxed venue than the office and may inspire the customer to share some valuable information 
Give it a tryit works well 
Lunch What should be on our agenda when we do lunch The primary objective of lunch is to thank 
them for their business Dont do lunch until after you are doing business with them During lunch the 
dialogue should be  business Thank you for your business I want to continue our relationship by 
exploring other opportunities and  social Humanize the relationship and learn about some of their 
hobbies and interests Personally I will not do lunch with a customer until we have had an opportunity 
to do business together Lunch can easily be seen as an attempt to buy their business 
Dinner A great way to truly get to know your customer and show your appreciation The dialogue 
should be  business and  social The  business is simply to acknowledge their importance 
as customers and say thank youleave it at that and enjoy the evening However if the customer 
wants to talk shop all night go with itits their evening You might want to consider planning some 
social topics to safeguard against any extended periods of silence Also I suggest you make dinner a 
foursomeinclude spouses or significant others 
Where did the time go is a cry frequently heard among sales professionals working under the stress 
of increased demands The answer lies in the daily application of five timemanagement principles to 
organize your life using your time in the best possible way Through effective allocation and 
organization of your time you will have more control over your activities and reap the benefits of a 
proactive approach The sooner you make the decision to take action the sooner youll have more time 
to enjoy life and experience less stress At the end of the day it comes down to three options do it 
delegate it or dump it Enjoy your newfound freedom and the rewards of effective time management 
Work to livedont live to work

Chapter  Prospecting I Know Where You Are 
Hiding 

Overview 

Remember playing the game hideandseek as a child It was quite gratifying to find the person within 
the allotted time and then outsmart your friends by hiding where they would never find you Well in 
professional selling you and your competitor are constantly engaged in a different kind of 
hideandseek Its called prospectingcorporate hideandseek Potential customers are out there 
located in various geographical pockets throughout your territory Success goes to the one who is most 
creative in finding and developing new customers new markets 
Many sales experts and authors suggest that prospecting is the most important activity within the 
Sequential Model Filling your sales funnel is the key to your economic survival Your sales funnel is 
your inventory of potential customers Through prospecting customers enter your funnel as qualified 
potential A or B accounts each with its own sales cycle Every customer has different viscosity the 
time it takes to flow through the funnel and become an active account 

The emphasis on prospecting can vary among various selling fields but at the end of the day your 
success is determined by the quantity and quality of customers in your funnel Constant prospecting 
and cultivation of your market be it local or global is the lifeblood of any business All other activities 
center around your ability to keep the sales funnel full However a major oversight of many salespeople 
is that they ignore an emptying funnel They become so focused and excited about developing new 
leads they fail to remain focused on their commitment to ongoing prospecting Its not long before they 
realize their funnel is empty and panic sets in This could be disastrous as it may be weeks or months 
before another potential customer works through the funnel Be cognizant of your funnel inventory and 
continue to fill it with new opportunities all while servicing and growing existing accounts 

As a sales entrepreneur you must actively pursue new potential accounts to ensure you meet and 
exceed your sales and personal goals With a customer attrition rate of approximately  and the 
constant threat of local and global competition you cant afford to ignore the significant contribution 
prospecting makes to a business Without a commitment to growth how do you expect to meet or 
exceed those new quota targets assigned to you every year You wont Remember employers reward 
results not activities 

Speaking of growth its important that as a sales entrepreneur you understand the difference between 
economic growth and real growth 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Growth Versus Real Growth 

Time for a quick lesson in sales economics  Very few salespeople management included 
appreciate the difference between economic growth and real growth I bring this concept forward 
because I have seen many salespeople and sales managers base performance appraisals and 
productivity on the wrong indicator Growth is a result of a strong buoyant economy growth due to 
outside factors such as low interest rates high consumer confidence high demand and limited supply 
Your business becomes the beneficiary of economic growth stimulated by a strong active economy 
You did nothing to stimulate ityou only reacted to it This scenario often creates a false sense of 
productivity throughout the company as management proudly highfives each other In boardrooms they 
exclaim Arent we great we are  ahead of last years numbers Wow were awesome Whos 
kidding whom Yes you may be up  but so is everybody else in your industry Youre all on the 
bandwagon together riding on the coattails of strong economic growth However real growth is over and 
above economic growthgrowth on top of growth Real growth is stimulated by effective prospecting 
and is critical for longterm success For example if the economy generates  economic growth 
your goal may be to achieve  real growth in addition to the  Thus when the economic wave 
crashes they usually do and the  growth evaporates youre still left with  growthprobably  
more than your competitors Thats real growth It doesnt take very long to see and appreciate the 
tremendous impact real growth has on a business Salespeople and managers usually dont think about 
growth in these terms Its time you did Reevaluate your productivity and challenge yourself Is my 
business growing or is it really growing Clearly your objective as a sales entrepreneur is to drive real 
growth Dont simply respond to a natural economic growth spurt 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Where to Find Them  Ideas 

With that end in mind I offer you the following  prospecting sources to help stimulate real growth 
within your territory and your businessME INC 

 
Newspapers Review the business section want ads and business articles to get 
company names and ideas as to whom you might want to approach Look for corporate 
announcements as well The newspaper can provide lots of ideas 
 
Industry Associations Get a listing of companies and individuals who belong to 
specific associationslegal medical engineering and so on Consider offering yourself 
as a keynote speaker at their next meeting They are always looking for ways to spice 
up their meetingsmaybe youre the answer If you are terrified of speaking to a group 
bring along someone from your company who enjoys it Your company will look good 
and youll get the leads 
 
Yellow Pages This is an excellent source of businesses within your territory Start 
calling from the back of the book with the Zs and work forward Most salespeople start 
at A and never get past the Es Chances are good that businesses toward the back of 
the book have never been called You may want to consider purchasing Yellow Pages 
from other cities that are within your geographical territory Alternatively you can 
access Yellow Pages for any city on the Internet 
 
Vehicles on the Road Get company names and phone numbers painted on the 
hundreds of trucks service vehicles and company vans you see every day They may 
even have a tollfree number proudly displayed so use your handy tape recorder to 
record the information Then follow up 
 
Trade Shows You cant get a faster introduction to a large number of customers all 
under one roof I have met some of my largest customers at trade shows However 
dont be intrusive and try to sell them at the show Rather ask a few upfront questions 
to determine their potential then get a name to follow up with later Call your local 
convention center or chamber of commerce and get a calendar of upcoming events 
 
Library Use your local library It often has current business publications annual 
reports and an archive of newspaper articles on microfiche Make a copy of relevant 
articles announcements and want ads Then put them in your prospecting file for future 
followup 
 
The Internet The worlds largest library is at your fingertips If its not on the Net it 
hasnt been thought of or invented yet Use it to retrieve valuable information about a 
specific industry investigate new technologies related to your field subscribe to mailing 
lists tap into a newsgroup and so on The Internet offers a plethora of opportunities for 
prospecting and sources of information otherwise unavailable to you However I caution 
you It can be timeconsuming Dont become a mouse potato and waste away selling 
hours or janitorial hours distracted by the fun of it 
 
Friends and Allies Ask among your circle of friends and current business allies for 
referrals They are often willing to help you outsimply for the price of asking After all 
the more people you know the more people youre capable of knowing As one of my 
friends said Its not who you know its who I know 
 
Breakfast Clubs Consider joining one that helps you network They are always looking 
for new blood new members Alternatively offer yourself as a speakerthey often look 
for interesting people to feature as a keynote Talk about an exciting interesting new 
technology developed by your company or emerging trends within your industry Heck 
youll probably get a free breakfast out of it and its a great way to get your day started 
 
Old Files Take a gander through old files in the office Im sure youll find some orphan 
accountsperhaps even some potential bornagain accounts 
 
Target Markets Pursue a specific profession and learn what you can about it For 
example it might be legal medical communication transportation construction food 
service and so on However dont try to spread yourself too thin Concentrate on one or 
two specific professions and become an expert in that field 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

 
Subscriptions Subscribe to appropriate business magazines They are often rich with 
corporate articles and advertisements that may introduce you to the new kid on the 
block or to a company you havent heard of before 
 
Referrals Perhaps the most overlooked source for new business Simply ask existing 
customers for a couple of names that they would be comfortable passing along There 
are plenty of books and seminars outlining effective strategies of networking I suggest 
you consider honing your networking skills because the return on your investment is 
like no other 
 
Business Directories Several companies offer business directories that list all the 
businesses in your area Listings include size locations presidents name executives 
revenue product lines and key contacts These directories can be purchased for a 
nominal fee and can be broken down by geographical area revenue size or by number 
of employees Some directories have the option of crossreferencing phone numbers 
addresses subsidiaries and parent companies It can be a worthwhile investment 
 
Internal Customers Nonsales employees can be encouraged to provide leads An 
uncle cousin or a friend who works at a company might be a potential customer Even 
the people in the service department could be very helpful to you Some companies 
support this method by offering a financial incentive for every prospective customer they 
pass along If the company doesnt pay an incentive consider offering one yourselfeven 
if its only a  gift certificate for a local restaurant People generally respond favorably 
to gestures of appreciation 
 
Observation Keep your eyes and ears open We are bombarded daily with thousands 
of messagesbillboards radio advertisements banners TV and so on Look for 
anything new within or around your territoryconstruction an information sign on a 
building or remodelling in progress Take an unfamiliar route to your existing customer 
to see whats going on in and around your territory Dont drive by and wonderstop in 
and find out 
 
Building Directories Every office building has a directory on the main floor that lists 
the businesses throughout the building I used to take a picture of it or recite the names 
into my tape recorder then follow up by telephone and qualify for any possible potential 
customers 
 
Social Contacts This goes beyond your immediate circle of friends and family to 
include neighbors members of social community and religious organizations former 
classmates and any other group whose members might buy the type of product or 
service that you offer These social events are an opportunity to meet new and 
interesting people However be tactful when pursuing these contacts Dont come 
across as the leech whos always looking for a leadwho looks at every social event as 
a potential sale Simply have an informal business chat and agree to follow up during 
regular business hours or when its convenient 
 
Existing Accounts Look for additional opportunities within your active accounts We 
can get very complacent working with only one department or one division sometimes 
overlooking other opportunities that are right under our nose Ask for a current 
organizational chart and prospect the entire companytake your blinders off 
 
Acquisitions and Mergers Read the business section of your local newspaper and 
watch for any announcements of acquisitions andor mergers Your favorite account 
could triple in size overnight and open up an opportunity to pursue new businessreal 
growth Armed with an endorsement as an incumbent your chances of success within 
the new company are excellent 
 
Social Clubs Consider joining a social club or a service club such as a Rotary Club 
Lions Club or The Chamber of Commerce It not only gives you an opportunity to 
volunteer for a worthy cause it is a great avenue for networking 
 
Cold Calling I have saved the best for last The dreaded cold call The very thought of 
it sets in motion all sorts of immobilizing defence mechanisms and excuses Most 
salespeople have somehow convinced themselves that cold calling is unprofessional 
intrusive and unnecessary I hear them say We dont make cold calls in our business 
We get leads from referrals tradeshows ads and our regular customers Thats all fine

and good but dont be too quick to abdicatevery few businesses are immune to the 
benefits of cold calling It is the backbone of good prospecting and when done properly 
it will yield high potential prospects Cold calling can be a very lucrative part of your 
sales strategy

Professional Cold Calling 

By definition a cold call is where you know absolutely nothing about a particular account and you drop 
in unannounced to qualify them You have never made a visit to that account before The only familiarity 
lies in the fact you have been driving past it for a year 
Often a lack of coldcalling confidence driven by fear sabotages the best intentions Overcoming that 
fear begins with an effective professional coldcalling strategy Most authors would agree that cold 
calling in itself is not unprofessional but the approach has tarnished its reputation Nowhere is it written 
that cold calling is taboo In fact without cold calling your customer base is not as rich and varied and 
you seriously jeopardize real growth and the success of your business The reality is that fear is the 
biggest barrier to an effective cold calling campaign Fear of rejection embarrassment and feeling 
awkward in a strange environment Its much easier to pursue the comfortable route and have 
businesses come in by other means rather than expose yourself to the possible perils of cold calling 

You can no longer afford to deny yourself or your business the tremendous benefits of cold calling To 
that end I offer you the following three steps as a guideline to making professional resultsoriented cold 
calls This approach may not be applicable in all situations so massage it to fit your sales arena By the 
way one big plus of cold calling is that youll never be late 


 
Introduction When you arrive introduce yourself to the receptionist using these four 
components in order  your name  your company name  what you do and  
that you are cold calling Dont try to skirt the issue tell the receptionist upfront that 
you are cold calling Next step is to ask them for their help Most of the time they will 
be quite receptive to helping Gatekeepers see a lot of salespeople come and go 
throughout the day so be sure your approach is professional friendly and respectful 
Heck the absolute worst thing that can happen is they ask you to leave Thats OK 
next 
 
Planning Because its a cold call you know nothing or very little about this business 
so do some homework First ask the receptionist for her help Would you mind helping 
me out by answering a few questions In most cases she will oblige Second ask her 
for a corporate package ie annual report company brochures newsletters anything 
that will help you better understand the business Refer to Chapter  for more detailed 
information that may be helpful with your coldcall planning and preparation Take some 
time in the lobby to review the material Dont leave yet 
 
Announce Yourself Now its time to announce yourself but be sure its to the right 
person Throughout your planning you have learned that Bert is the manager and he 
may be your contact However its not Bert you want to see at least not yet Ask who 
Berts boss is and announce yourself to that person Go at least one level up to Susan 
Follow the theory that its easier to work downhill than uphill Pick up the phone in the 
lobby or use your cell phone and call Susan directly Why have a busy overworked 
gatekeeper announce you Announce yourself Who is better suited to introduce 
yourself than you 
When she answers you need to restate the four components of your introduction including the fact that 
you are cold calling I have found many executives are impressed when you tell them that you are in 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

their lobby making a cold call After your introduction be sure to say this Susan I realize you 
generally work with appointments and that I am unannounced but would you have a second to 
exchange business cards Its very important to acknowledge that you are unannounced and without 
an appointment Thats what makes your cold call professional and different from the others Also by 
asking to exchange business cards Susan will associate that with a shorter time period than if you 
had asked Do you have a minute The other advantage is that it attaches a purpose to your 
introduction whereas Got a minute is somewhat ambiguous If Susan comes out to meet you offer 
your business card and again acknowledge that you are unannounced without an appointment If 
Susan declines your request to meet in the lobby ask her when she is available and use your time 
management system to book an appointment 

Now that you have met Susan and exchanged pleasantries use PSIPChapter to guide your 
conversation ask her if she has a couple minutes to answer a few quick questions If she says yes 
take advantage of this opportunity and ask questions to further qualify the account and also identify who 
the decision maker is who is the bag of money However your first question should be How much 
time do I have Show respect for her time After all you are unannounced During your conversation 
ask Susan these five questions 

 Does Bert make the decisions 
 Does Bert have a budget 
 Will Bert talk to you prior to a decision 
 Will you introduce me to Bert 
 If Bert approves of our proposal may I accompany Bert when he presents to you 
If the answer is yes to  you know Susan makes the decisions not Bert However you will have to 
respect Berts position and sell him on your proposal Otherwise it will never go any further 

Question  is what I refer to as corporate cascading Susan introducing you to Bert Powerful stuff 
Because your introduction to Bert was through Susan Bert will be receptive to meet you Bert wont be 
upset with you for going over his head because you have never met him before He can only be curious 
as to your approach 

If Susan is not in the office or is unavailable try to meet briefly with her executive assistant Assistants 
can be informative and helpful They may also book appointments for Susan If not ask her to check 
with Susan for available meeting times 

The SusanBert strategy is a very effective approach to cold calling I have used it successfully for 
years Rather than do a typical cold call where you leave a business card and a brochure and depart 
emptyhanded consider implementing the SusanBert strategy 
However before you throw this book down and protest your resistance to cold calling you dont have to 
do it all the time Im not suggesting that cold calling become your modus operandi but it can be very 
effective at appropriate times The two best times are to fill in blank time caused by cancelled 
appointments or to plan a half day in a certain area of your territory to cold call For example upon 
learning that your  AM appointment was cancelled dont go back to the adult daycare center go cold 
calling and make productive use of the time before your next appointment My informal research 
suggests that  of the time you cold call you find at least one new potential account As Woody 
Allen says  of life is showing up 

Although prospecting is the lifeblood to any successful business it remains one of the most feared and 
avoided activities of selling Overcoming reluctance to prospecting means developing a plan setting 
goals and keeping good records To help build your confidence you may want to consider doing a 
ridealong with an experienced sales entrepreneur who is good at prospecting Tag along for the 
afternoon and simply observe how its done Observation is a powerful learning tool 
As you build your confidence experiment with different methods and ideas to find the prospecting 
combination that works well for you and your business There is no single universal method no optimal 
mode to fit all situations Your prospecting strategies need to be situational to your sales arena 
maximizing your ROT return on time equity I dont suggest that all  ideas will work for you but do 
concentrate on developing a combination of methods and you will see it stimulate your business and 
drive real growth Become an expert in the methods that have the greatest impact on your productivity

Chapter  Building Rapport and Trust Behavioral 
Flexibility 

Overview 

Behavioral flexibility is proving to be one of the most useful tools you can add to your intellectual 
inventory your professional equity Understanding style types and learning how to adjust not change 
your approach fosters rapport and trust with your customer while helping meet and exceed your 
customers communication expectations Sales entrepreneurs understand that the full dynamics of 
interpersonal communication go beyond the basic communication model of sender encoding and 
receiver decoding 

Different customers require different selling approaches Behavioral flexibility provides a tool for us to 
adapt to different selling situations Its application continues to grow in popularity as business people 
learn to appreciate the tremendously positive impact behavioral flexibility has on relationships 

Building and maintaining rapport and trust are the cornerstones to any relationship So whats the 
difference between rapport and trust Rapport can be instantaneous or developed in a very short period 
of time It means having something in common with the party you are meeting Part of forming a first 
impression is deciding whether you like this person enough to continue the conversation without 
barriers Sometimes when you meet someone new you instantly feel good about him or her Rapport 
develops quickly Perhaps its like the love at first sight feeling Trust takes longer Trust is developed 
over time and is based on honesty consistency integrity and professionalism Its following through on 
your commitments and promises I may initially like you rapport but it may take a bit of time before I 
trust you Thus rapport and trust must work in accord for the relationship to advance These are two 
common denominators to any endeavor in life and to any relationship including relations with your 
internal customers kids siblings and spouse 

The pioneer who developed the psychology of style types was a Swiss psychologist Dr Carl Jung He 
initially observed differences in his parents behavioral styles and his fascination led to years of studying 
the differences among people He began his research in the late s and in  he wrote Psychology 
Types Jungs research eventually revealed four basic behavioral types Initiator Thinker Feeler and 
Sensor Most of his work focuses on internal characteristics that lead to external behaviors Another 
point to consider It is suggested that you are born with a predominate style that does not change as 
you go through life Once a thinker always a thinker Thats not to say you dont experience traits from 
the other styles you do Jungs work simply suggests that you have a primary personality style The 
four styles I refer to later in this chapter are Socializer Director Thinker and Relater all evolving from 
Carl Jungs work

How Do I Get Them to Like Me 

Behavioral adaptability is the key to successful application of the behavioral flexibility model 
Adaptability means you have the maturity and confidence to behave in a style that may not be your 
primary style but that reflects the style of your customer Sales entrepreneurs consciously go out of 
their comfort zone in order to establish a relationship of rapport and trust 
By recognizing the styles of yourself and others you can adapt your behavior to fit the situation 
Adapting speeds up the likeable factor People are naturally drawn to likeminded people with similar 
styles If you can embrace and parallel the behavioral style of your customers they cant help but 
appreciate your approach and consciously or unconsciously begin to like you In their book The Art of 
Speedreading People Paul and Barbara Tieger talk about the tremendous sales advantage of 
speedreading your customersidentifying the customers style type and adapting They go on to 
suggest that your next goal is to speedreach your customercommunicate on the customers own 
level based on the style type you have identified You need to observe and listen carefully to your 
customer and respond in the way that best accommodates his or her behavioral type 
Developing your skill in reading and interpreting peoples behavioral style helps manage the initial 
tension that exists in any new relationship As Tony Alessandra says in his book People Smarts You 
can learn to adapt your style to handle different types of situations even the more difficult ones that we 
encounter in the realworld laboratory of life He goes on to suggest this tool is not about changing its 
about acting in a sensible successful way to nurture a lasting relationship Perhaps Dr Richard 
Carlson says it most succinctly in his book Dont Sweat the Small Stuff and its all small stuff 

For many people one of the most frustrating aspects of life is not being able to understand other 
peoples behavior We see them as guilty instead of innocent Its tempting to focus on peoples 
seemingly irrational behaviortheir comments actions meanspirited acts selfish behaviorand get 
extremely frustrated If we focus on behavior too much it can seem like other people are making us 
miserable Its true that other people do weird things who doesnt but we are the ones getting upset 
so we are the ones who need to change Im merely talking about learning to be less bothered by the 
actions of people 
Carlson goes on to suggest that When someone is acting in a way we dont like the best strategy for 
dealing with that person is to look beyond it and see the innocence in where the behavior is coming 
from 

Parallel to Carlsons thinking I offer this explanation of behavioral flexibility An understanding of the 
behavior model gives us the patience to tolerate other people and their actionsincluding internal 
customers such as spouse kids and family You cant change your style or other peoples styles but 
you can change the relationship

Four Behavioral Styles of Customers 

The following style grid outlines the four styles and positions them in relation to the vertical and 
horizontal axis 


The vertical axis is the openness scale which refers to how willing the person is to be open and to 
reveal what is happening on the inside At the top we have highly open talkative friendly 
relationshiporiented individuals extroverts At the bottom we find selfcontained quiet very closed 
individuals introverts The introverts are selfcontained people usually expressionless not revealing 
their feelings thoughts or emotions Their world is internal and it can be difficult to read them or know 
what theyre thinking Comparatively the extroverts readily show excitement joy enthusiasm anger 
and a variety of emotions 
The horizontal axis is referred to as the directness scale direct or indirect People who are direct on 
the right side make decisions quickly and easily not a lot of details are required These people are 
spontaneous Sure sounds good lets do it Their motto is Its easier to get forgiveness than 
permission People who are indirect on the left side are not as comfortable making quick decisions 
They move more cautiously arriving at a decision more slowly A direct individual may very well get 
frustrated by the amount of time an indirect person takes to make a decision Conversely an indirect 
person is not impressed with how quickly and recklessly a direct person makes decisions Its all about 
understanding that people are different Your interactions with people succeed when you heed their 
external signals Interactions fail when you ignore the signals Now for the bad news and good news 
the bad news is there is only one thing you can control and change the good news is its you Dont try 
to change other people you cant The high divorce rate proves it Even marriage counselors are in 
agreement that the behavioral flexibility model goes a long way toward improving relationships The 
following pages outline the primary characteristics of each style Lets have a look at each style and as 
you read through them try to ascertain the style that best fits your behavior at work and at home 

Socializer 

These are funloving extroverts social people who are full of life and always appear to be enjoying 
themselves having fun Their preference is party first business second The best way to get their 
attention and build rapport is to have fun with them before you get down to business They are 
energetic enthusiastic talkative and literally the life of any party They are sharp dressers very stylish 
and sometimes outrageous Socializers are not afraid of drawing attention to themselves in fact they 
prefer it They love toys and often drive highend sports cars red Porsches Lamborghinis or Dodge 
Stealths They also have all the accessories jewelry expensive watches shoes pens etc A  
outfit with all the trimmings is not uncommon 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


The downside about Socializers is that they are poor listeners and inattentive since they are usually 
focused on talking about themselves Its sometimes tough to get a word in edgewise as they tell you 
their life stories and fondest dreams Nevertheless you must give them time to chat and party with you 
before asking business questions 

A word of caution Socializers hate detail and boring lengthy presentations They can be very impatient 
Make it fun colorful exciting and get to the bottom line quickly Sell the sizzle more than the steak 
Bottom line to a Socializer means How will this make me look good and will it be fun Get the deal in 
writing Socializers tend to forget quickly as they move on to the next event or party The best vehicle to 
build trust and rapport is to put fun into the relationship Energize your call with enthusiasm and 
excitement After all if you have fun socializing and pass the party test by listening to the jokes and 
stories then it only stands to reason that you will be a trustworthy enjoyable person to do business 
with The big plus is that they will and do make quick decisions direct as you move through the steps 
of your Sequential Model In summary 


Director 

Here is your consummate businessperson an introvert whose main focus is the task at hand and who 
is guided by goals and objectives Directors are always asking Whats the point Thus its always 
business first party maybe Get to the point quickly and dont socialize or try to encourage social 
conversation They will become impatient and tune out quickly as they are simply not interested 
Directors love control and prefer to be in charge they like being the boss As an introvert they have a 
low tolerance for feelings and emotions Directors can appear to be quiet unfriendly and apathetic 
Directors are quite happy to do things on their ownsee a movie dine in a restaurant or even travel 
They will tell you Im alone but not lonely 

Directors often prefer to give cash or gift certificates as gifts rather than take the time to shop Their 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

dress is usually dark blue and conservative nothing flashy or terribly stylish If a Director is wearing a 
flashy tie you can feel safe in asking Nice tie who bought it for you They drive conservative 
functional cars such as a Reliant or a Taurus Dont touch a Director in fact handshakes are 
unnecessary They like their personal space We are here to do business not get married A Director 
is not concerned about the relationship they just care about your performance as a professional and 
how the performance of your product or service will contribute to the bottom line Dont have an 
emotional outburst crying in a Directors office He or she will be unmoved and unimpressed Get 
yourself togetherthen carry on with the conversation No sniffling allowed Remember Directors have 
a need for power and control that cannot be ignored by a pushy sales representative They are 
motivated by bottomline detail In summary 


Thinker 

The two main components of a Thinker are indirect slow decisions and selfcontained introvert These 
individuals are typically your engineers accountants and computer programmers Its information first 
then business You dont have much hope of doing business with them until you deliver all the required 
data for them to make an informed intelligent decision Thinkers hate to be wrongit drives them crazy 
when mistakes are made Thats why they are indirect not making decisions quickly avoiding 
mistakes They are very detailedoriented and precise often guided by the letter of the law versus the 
spirit of the law Presentations to Thinkers must be logical accurate and reliable Thinkers are the 
ones who will lure you into a feature dump They love it Rather than spewing reams of information ask 
them what they would like to see They will tell you whats important to them so make sure you provide 
it I suggest you openly acknowledge their need for information then ask What specific information 
would you need to see to build your confidence to buy from me Build confidence by presenting 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

appropriate information guided by the Thinkers feedback Dumping wheelbarrels of data in their office for 
their perusal only lengthens the sales cycle Edit your dialogue with data that are relevant and 
appropriate to the Thinker 


Expect Thinkers to compare your product or service to the competition Seldom will they accept 
information at face value Impulse buying is very uncomfortable for them They prefer to research 
manufacturers specifications and converse with experts in that field Dont argue with them there isnt 
much chance of winning Why Because they have thoroughly researched the subject and have the 
data to back themselves up and they will pursue the argument until they are victorious In some cases 
Thinkers attitudes are Im right and youre wrong but its your right to be wrong 

Of the four styles Thinkers are the ones least concerned with dressits not important Their clothes 
are a bit worn and generally a bit out of style They sometimes wear a plastic pocket protector full of Bic 
pens and use duct tape to fix their glasses I know some Thinkers who insist on hanging toilet paper 
correctly exercising proper toilet paper management so that it rolls off the top This is an important 
detail to Thinkers and in fact they have been known to correct it when they get home They sometimes 
even correct it at a friends home just to help out It has been the topic of many heated matrimonial 
discussions Of course the Directors are thinking Who cares Im happy if theres paper on the back of 
the toilet 

Thinkers tend to be packrats never throwing anything out Their garages and basements are jammed 
with old stuff because You just never know when it might be useful Heck they even have their 
university text books and notes somewhere in the basement 

Thinkers focus on two important aspects of selling accuracy and an eye to detail They are particular 
on their paperwork which is appreciated by internal customers They tend to do a job right the first 
time whereas Socializers may have to redo it several times as they often overlook important details In 
summary 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Relater 

The two main components of a Relater are indirect slow decisions and open extrovert These 
individuals are very sensitive often taking business issues personally They are very intuitive accurately 
reading peoples nonverbal behaviors Relaters are bigtime team players and they encourage harmony 
among the team be it at work socially or at home with their family Relaters are emotional empathetic 
people who are moved to tears easily and can be oversensitive Take a Relater to see Titanic and watch 
what happens They cry very easily Yes even male Relaters Directors would be inclined to think 
Why are you crying you knew the darn thing sank in  Relaters are often appalled at the 
apparent apathy of Directors taking their verbal and nonverbal responses literally Relaters hate conflict 
of any sort They go to great lengths to avoid hassles talking their way out of conflict They are very 
conforming and go with the flow versus doing it solo Relaters are good listeners and ask more than tell 
Relaters are motivated by the relationship hoping everybody will like them They must be popular and 
tend to make decisions slowly indirect so as to not offend or upset anyone with an unpopular decision 
When shopping Relaters will often ask Whats popular whats selling The use of references is very 
effective with Relatersthey build confidence in your product or service Relaters like to be assured that 
they are not the only ones using your product or service Your proposal must support or enhance the 
people side of the business concentrating on harmony security and concrete benefits Ask them 
frequently about their opinions and ideas In summary

How Will I Know When I See One 

There are two primary indicators of ones style verbal and visual As Tony Alessandra suggests there 
are observable characteristics for each stylevisual indicators such as environment dress vehicle 
office and how each verbalizes thoughts and ideas As well be cognizant of nonverbal gestures By 
observing how customers dress and express themselves and by listening to how and what they say 
you will quickly begin to identify their styles I suggest you begin by asking yourself Is he or she an 
introvert or an extrovert These traits can be rather obvious in their approach dress and work 
environment Look around their corporate livingroom office and observe what is and isnt there 
including pictures awards certificates type of furniture toys bricabrac and so on Then narrow it 
down to a particular quadrant keeping in mind that each individual exhibits characteristics and 
behaviors from each quadrant People are not restricted to the conduct associated with just one style 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Different Versus Difficult 

Know the difference between different and difficult Unfortunately it seems that few people do We are 
often too quick to label someone as difficult when they act or behave in a manner contrary to our 
behavior You see people are not difficult they are just different Its far too easy to label them as 
difficult rather than make the effort to understand them and appreciate their differences Thats what 
makes this tool such an asset to your professional equity Understand that peopleyour customers 
are different The key to a lasting trusting relationship is an adaptation to their style Abraham Lincoln 
once said I dont like that man very much I need to get to know him better What a great concept 
one from which we could all benefit 

As a new salesperson with a company you may have heard or even said this Dont bother going to 
see Hank at XYZ Company He is such a jerk and a real tough guy to get along with Plus he never 
buys anythinghes always just looking Hank may very well be a jerk they do exist but chances are 
that Hank is simply a different style type Hank is probably a neat guy once you get to know him A 
case in point I recently received a call from an excited graduate of my sales program She was ecstatic 
because she had just confirmed business with an account that had been labelled indifferent and not 
likely to buy from her She persevered and with the help of behavioral flexibility she secured a  
account Not a bad return on her training investment 
Another important aspect of successful adaptation is your willingness and confidence to stretch your 
comfort zone As discussed in Chapter  stretching your comfort zone is one of the pillars of success 
and is certainly a necessary attitude for successful implementation of behavioral flexibility We must be 
willing and able to stretch our range to accommodate other peoples styles 

So who makes the best salesperson Before I answer this common question put the book down and 
give it some thought Ill wait 

The answer is  the chameleonthe salesperson who can readily adapt to the style of each customer 
It doesnt matter which style you are What matters is how quickly and comfortably you can adapt to 
the style of the person you are interacting with at home or at work

General Observations 

At this point you are probably getting a good appreciation for differences among the four behavioral 
styles To further crystallize your understanding I offer these realworld everyday scenarios 

Reading a Newspaper 

 
Socializers look for stories about the party they were at the previous night They do 
things that get themselves in the paper They scan the entire paper looking for 
interesting currentevent articles They read the Entertainment section 
 
Directors mainly read the headlines and the business section They then turn to the 
sports section to read about athletic accomplishments 
 
Thinkers call the newspaper if a word is incorrectly spelled or a story is inaccurate 
 
Relaters look for a popular current event story to discuss at the office water cooler 
They check the obituaries to see if they know anyone 
Golfing 

 
Socializers spend more time in the clubhouse talking and welcoming new members 
Their almost a hole in one story is repeated frequently for the benefit of new 
members 
 
Directors drive the cart and frequently try to play through 
 
Thinkers keep score for the group and often refer to the rule book They keep their 
clubs clean too 
 
Relaters play regularly with the same foursome usually offering to buy the beverages 
at the th hole 
Grocery Shopping 

 
Socializers approach the fewer than  items checkout line begin a conversation 
and compare the fun stuff in other shopping carts They hold up the line by conversing 
with the cashier about upcoming holidays 
 
Directors approach and barrel through the fewer than  items line with  items 
After all it was the shortest line 
 
Thinkers approach the same checkout line wrestling with the correct thing to do Are 
the eggs one item or  They also count items in other carts and if they are over 
the limit they become irritated 
 
Relaters approach the fewer than  items line count the items and take comfort 
knowing they have only eight If they have ten items they move to another line 
The Desk 

 
Socializers say Im busy right now Give me a few minutes and Ill get back to you 
They dont know where the item is on their desk but wont admit it 
 
Directors have a clean desk one file out at a time Nothing else is on the desk Even 
their telephone is on the credenza behind them 
 
Thinkers say Its the third report down in that pile The desk is messy with 
PostItNotes and files everywhere but they know exactly where everything is 
 
Relaters have everything in place with the most impressive businessrelated file in 
full view A family picture and a picture of him or her shaking hands with a celebrity is 
in a prominent position Relaters have a separate table for visitors rather than sitting 
at their desk 
Cooking 

 
Socializers like to cook for groups They prepare an extra place at the table just in 
case company stops by They go out rather than cook for one 
 
Directors cant cook without a microwave They buy single portions Cooking is 
viewed as a functional necessity versus a social event 
 
Thinkers cook with a cookbook a timer and a measuring cup Directions are 
followed exactly with no deviations allowed 
 
Relaters like to prepare a meal from scratch using a dozen standard recipes taking 
the best from each and using the most popular ingredients 
Elevators 

 
Socializers let everyone in saying Always room for one more the more the 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

merrier They ignore the max limit sign and hand out business cards on the way 

down 

 
Directors walk up push the button wait impatiently get in and speak to no one If 
running late they take the stairs 
 
Thinkers enter but if its crowded they count the number of people If over the limit 
they will ask someone to leave 
 
Relaters hold the door for others and ensure theyre the last ones on in case its full 
They dont want to crowd anybody If so they will wait for the next elevator They 
smile at everyone on the trip down 
The development of any new skill takes practice and lots of it The first step requires your personal 
commitment to this challenge and belief in the behavioral flexibility principles I strongly encourage you 
to accept this opportunity to strengthen your relationship competencies and develop your interpersonal 
skills Lets face it you and your customer become the beneficiaries 

I suggest you practice by identifying the styles among members of your family coworkers and friends 
At your next social event sit back and consciously observe people their dress their actions how and 
with whom they converse and so on Youll be amazed at how much behavioral flexibility is real world 
and how people quickly reveal their predominant style 

As a guideline to practice ask yourself these questions 

 
Are they introvert or extrovert 
 
Do they appear to be direct or indirect 
 
How are they dressed 
 
What is their predominant quadrant 
Remember there is nothing mysterious about behavioral flexibility Its about treating people the way 
they want to be treated Everybody is different and no two customers are the same Whether the person 
is dominant or shy you will have the confidence and specific strategies for dealing successfully with 
that individual Remember people are not difficultjust different After all variety is the spice of  
sales A footnote Dont consider this chapter as your only resource to develop your behavioral flexibility 
skills There are many good publications dedicated to the subject and I suggest you consider building 
your own library on this subject See the bibliography

Chapter  Discovery Game Day 

The starters pistol has sounded and now is the moment of truth the opportunity to capitalize on all your 
preparatory efforts As you sit facetoface with your customer a goldmedal performance is your only 
option The sales arena presents no silver or bronze medals nor does it allow any false starts On 
game day Steps  through  of your Sequential Model are critical prerequisites to a stellar 
performance Chances are your competitor is in the same arena running the same race just on a 
different day 

Your challenge is to move the customer from a cold indifferent frame of mind to aroused excitement 
about you and your product or service Remember that salespeople are often viewed as an intrusion an 
interruption to an already busy day Unless you can change that basic attitude by reducing the initial 
tension you are doomed before you start The initial moments of a sales call are fraught with 
uncertainty and tension must be minimized However a certain level of tension is healthy and normal 
as it motivates you to higher levels of performance Sales entrepreneurs know how to transform nervous 
precall energy into a winning edge a confident approach The winning edge is an attitude of a 
champion Small differences in attitude and ability can translate into enormous differences in results A 
race horse may win by a nose or a PGA golfer by a single stroke but their winnings may be twice that 
of second place Are they twice as good or talented Of course not You and your competitor are both 
invited by the customer to compete You are both on the short list but only one will emerge victorious 
often winning only by a nose In sales its not your margin of victory that is important but whether you 
played the game to win embracing every possible advantage Remember your customer is the ultimate 
judge of your performance At the awards ceremony the gold medal is presented in the form of an order 

Needs Analysis 

Customer satisfaction begins with a careful diagnosis of needs and expectations You must sensitize 
yourself to your customers issues and focus on what your customer needs to buy rather than selling 
what you need to sell One more sale and I win the TV Through open and honest conversation you will 
discover the needs and expectations of your potential customer and begin to formulate a solution that 
differentiates you from your closest competitor Discovery then is asking questions through an 
exploratory discussion listening carefully and aligning your offerings to exceed your customers 
expectations 
The key to differentiation is asking intelligent questions questions your competitors dont ask or are 
afraid to pose Asking intelligent questions is the essence of an effective needs analysis that reveals the 
specifics about a possible solution However asking questions is not an isolated event where you show 
up to the appointment introduce yourself then proceed to inundate your customer with an onslaught of 
scripted questions Think of discovery as a dialogue a conversation between two people rather than a 
strategic engagement between a salesperson and a customer Before a customer will open up and 
share information that may lead to a sale you must get acquainted establish rapport gain trust and 
break through the mental barriers usually associated with firsttime sales calls You must demonstrate 
a genuine interest in the customer to advance the relationship Granted it is not easy to break through 
initial sales resistance negative perceptions and a general attitude of apathy toward salespeople 
Meeting a customer for the first time can be a nervewracking experience for even a seasoned sales 
professional Usually the first few minutes of a sales call are the most stressful for both the 
salesperson and the customer The customers stress comes in the form of uncertainty about the 
salespersons intentions and apprehension about seeing another sales rep Sales representatives 
experience stress because they often rely on little more than their good looks and the gift of the gab to 
carry them through the call However thousands of sales entrepreneurs are successful every day 
proving that customers are receptive if you demonstrate a genuine interest through an approach that is 
forged from your knowledge skills and confidence 

An effective approach requires a method designed to get the customers attention and interest quickly 
while guiding you through the most sensitive part of the call the first few minutes Your greatest ally 
throughout the call is the aftereffect of the positive first impression you made A favorable first 
impression usually produces a customer who is willing to participate Customers put tremendous faith 
in their perceptions and are quick to prejudge If you are perceived as professional and effective at the 
beginning of the call you will be perceived as effective during the rest of the call The customers 
receptivity to you will be decided within the first minute You never get a second chance to make a first

The PSIP Method 

Lets now explore the PSIP method Pleasantries Showoff Inform Probe PSIP represents the four 
navigational buoys of an effective opening strategy designed to help you neutralize initial tension and 
make a smooth transition into the needs analysis stage All four components of PSIP must work in 
accord with each other in order to take advantage of this proven approach A wellexecuted PSIP 
strategy is your springboard into a smooth opening and is a great confidence builder early in the call It 
is a great way to launch into the heart of the sales call relax the initial tension stripping away the 
stiffness of the call A strong opening strategy arouses the customers curiosity and respect often 
setting the tone for the entire call including telephone calls 

The PSIP method is not reserved for firsttime sales calls only It also works well with existing 
customers Just as the Sequential Model must be applied to every sales situation PSIP must also be 
utilized at every sales call regardless of your customers tenure 
Pleasantries Customers form an opinion about you within  seconds even before you speak They 
evaluate your posture dress hygiene grooming and attitude 
Pleasantries include two aspects visual and verbal First impressions encompass both aspects and 
can be a tremendous asset or a costly liability Many salespeople make a poor impression without 
realizing it by overlooking important details such as proper dress punctuality grooming and overall 
professionalism You cant afford to let any aspect of your approach visual or verbal compromise the 
impression you communicate to your customer Be cognizant of the impact of your physical 
appearance and how it can affect your customers evaluation of you Your visual assets how you look 
to the customer are something to be proud of This is an important aspect of nonverbal communication 
Show up on time feeling good looking good thinking good and ready to do business Emulate the 
attitude of a winner a champion Customers want to deal with winners so look like one The most 
important presentation you make is to yourself every morning in the mirror 

Verbal pleasantries means initiating social conversation with the customer using local events current 
events or global events as possible topics of conversation Take  minutes before you leave the house 
or your hotel and peruse the morning paper perhaps the business section or the sports section Be 
informed It can be a great icebreaker and a source of conversation especially if youre from out of 
town During the pleasantries stage try to keep the conversation social Encourage your customer to 
respond on a personal level rather than on a formal business level A short humorous personal story 
such as Youll never guess what happened to me this morning    identifies you as a real human 
being It can do wonders to help people relax 
Another big advantage of the pleasantries stage is the opportunity it provides to identify your customers 
behavioral style Ask yourself What quadrant is she in and How do I need to adjust The 
pleasantries stage begins to reveal preferred styles by way of dress and mannerisms A talkative 
response or a quick short answer to your questions will tell you a lot about your customers style 
Behavioral styles and behavioral flexibility are discussed in detail throughout Chapter  

The key to forging a longterm relationship with your customer is to build rapport by way of adjusting to 
your customers preferred behavioral style By definition rapport means having something in common a 
link some way to connect with your customer Use behavioural flexibility coupled with appropriate 
social conversation to build rapport Dont rely on a picture of a sailboat hanging in the office to 
stimulate conversation It can be viewed as a shallow approach to building rapport and Im sure your 
customer is sick of talking about it every time a sales representative comes into the office 

Depending upon the customers style the pleasantries stage can be as quick as one minute or as long 
as fifteen minutes Remember each call is situational I caution you to safeguard yourself against 
conversational drift Dont let the talkative customer dominate all your time with such topics as religion 
capital punishment or empty chatter that compromises the objective of the pleasantry stage 

During the pleasantry stage you begin to understand your customers preferred business style just as 
the customer will have a good feeling about you and your level of confidence By the way my previous 
point about a customer forming an opinion about you within  seconds works both ways You too 
begin to form an impression about your customer early and quickly 

The best advice I can offer for the pleasantries stage is to be yourself guided by a positive attitude and 
the confidence that comes with effective planning and preparation 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

Showoff The second stage of PSIP is the opportunity to show off your newfound wisdom Take a 
subtle approach By way of conversation and visual evidence annual reports brochures let the 
customer know youve done your homework This is the point where social conversation pleasantries 
shifts to business conversation You have invested some nonselling janitorial hours in planning and 
preparing so now its time to get a return on that investment Your return comes in the form of the 
customers appreciation for your obvious commitment and professionalism As discussed in Chapter  
take an Oh by the way approach to present your information Take out their annual report and any 
brochures that you received prior to the call and refer to them For example Oh by the way I noticed 
in your annual report some comments about your recent acquisition of ABC Company or I noticed in 
your brochures you manufacture ten different models You can even use competitive intelligence to 
show off by saying I understand your competitors have discontinued manufacturing their    This 
demonstrates your knowledge of their industry as well as their business Powerful stuff What better 
way to get your customers interest and attention and build credibility than by talking about their 
business The examples of showoff items are endless but be sure to relate your showoff items to 
current relevant information about their business 

A case in point My associate and I made a sales call to the head office of a company We arrived early 
for our appointment and had an opportunity to review some additional literature displayed in their lobby 
Our contact the VP of Quality and Training introduced himself and showed us into the boardroom We 
had barely sat down working through the pleasantries stage when he asked us What do you know 
about our company With great enthusiasm my associate produced their annual report and a few of 
their brochures attained prior to the appointment and then proceeded to talk about their business We 
had done our homework The customer was impressed with our knowledge We had earned the right to 
proceed with the call and the next hour went very well His confidence in us led to an introduction to the 
VP of Sales and Marketing a pivotal decisionmaker in the sales process 

The showoff stage has tremendous impact on the outcome of your sales call I think more and more 
customers are going to openly challenge salespeople about the extent of their knowledge Without the 
benefit of planning you put yourself in a perilous situation sitting in the customers office with a look on 
your face that resembles a deer caught in the headlights The showoff stage of PSIP is an excellent 
way to differentiate yourself not to mention the confidence derived from having conversational 
knowledge about your potential customer 
Inform The Inform stage of PSIP provides an opportunity to inform your customer about what you are 
selling and the reason for your visit I refer to this stage as synchronizing the call advising the customer 
of your call objectives This helps align your call agenda to the customers buying agenda Amazingly 
customers are often subjected to longwinded feature dumps but are never really sure what the 
objective is or what the sales representative is trying to accomplish I have witnessed calls where the 
customer and the salesperson are completely out of sync The expectations of each are totally different 
Perhaps I should have titled this book Synchronized Selling 
Getting in sync with your customer means asking a few upfront questions to evaluate his or her 
understanding of what you represent Ask Have you heard of our company before and Do you know 
what we do If the customer answers no to either question give a quick overview of who you are and 
what you are selling Synchronize the call Dont feature dump them with reams of useless information 
but rather respond with an informative two to threeminute information statement Consider this your 
corporate infomercial To add impact to your information statement include a few key benefits that 
previous customers have come to appreciate This stage of PSIP need not take more than three to five 
minutes Brevity is a virtue 
Probe The entrepreneurial style of selling places emphasis on probing for needs and expectations 
exploring for an opportunity to satisfy an existing inconvenience or dissatisfaction with a current vendor 
Skillful use of questions is the essence of an effective needs analysis which of course is the 
prerequisite to a creative tailored solution Creative solutions drive the relationship There is a direct 
correlation between the success of salespeople and their confidence to ask superior questions The 
challenge is not the ability to ask questions but rather the confidence to ask enough of the right 
questions I have seen countless situations where salespeople make the mistake of asking only a few 
scripted questions then launch into an enthusiastic wellrehearsed feature dump based on what they 
think should be of interest to the customer Rarely do they plan the questions they will ask Sales 
entrepreneurs realize that the questions you ask customers are more important than anything you tell 
them By answering questions customers state their ideas thoughts and needs in their own words If 
they say it its true If you say it they can doubt you They quickly sense your presentation feature 
dump is based on your own selfserving interests and the reaction is sure to be negative You must be 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

interested as well as interesting Imagine the impression you would create on a blind date if you did 
most of the talking and didnt ask any questions It wouldnt make for a very interesting conversation I 
dont think there would be a second date just as there wont be a second appointment with a potential 
customer 
Most customers divulge as little as possible especially during the early stage of the call Unless you 
probe with smart questions they give you only average information Dumb questions begets dumb 
information which means you deliver a dumb solution Dumb information means its the same 
information your competitor received Your customer will tell you that your solution is dumb by saying 
Interesting thats exactly what your competitor told me Superior questions help you avoid the metoo 
presentation the cookiecutter syndrome Customers purchase differences not similarities Dont be 
caught sitting in your customers office giving new meaning to the movie Dumb and Dumber 

Unfortunately few salespeople exploit the tremendous benefits that superior questions have on the 
selling relationship The effective use of superior questions moves the selling process forward at a 
steady but unpressured pace while achieving your call agenda of discovering precisely what your 
customers needs are Your objective is to lead your customer to a higher level of thinking Your 
questions should stimulate the customer to go beyond conventional thinking and responses 
Remember the quality of your questions determines the quality of your solution If you do not identify 
the customers dominant buying motivestheir hotbuttonsyour solution will be no better and no 
different than your competitors Differentiate yourself by asking smart questions and avoid the risk of 
being perceived as a commodity a metoo solution Probe in a manner that communicates sincerity 
genuine interest and empathy You and your customer are engaged in a dialogue a fluid seamless 
conversation exploring the possibility of a winwin relationship

Probe Architecture Peel the Onion 

I use the word architecture because thats what needs to happen You must design smart questions to 
ask Probes unquestionably persuade more powerfully than any other form of verbal behavior The 
success of a sales call depends more than anything else on how thorough your needs analysis is The 
effort you invest in developing and asking smart questions to uncover customer needs biases 
perceptions and fears that are not normally revealed to salespeople will pay off handsomely The 
ultimate prize will go to the one who asks the best questions I refer to the practice of asking smart 
questions as peeling the onion As with dicing an onion stupid questions common questions may 
cause your customers eyes to glaze over and communicate impatience The more layers you can peel 
away from suspicious apprehensive customers the sooner you get to the heart of their needs Ask 
stupid questions and you get useless information probably the same information your competitor 
walked away with I think Werner Heisberg a Nobel Prizewinning physicist said it best Nature does 
not reveal its secrets it only responds to our method of questioning 

The object is to design probes to encourage your customers to reveal their needspeel the onion 
Standard practice is to distinguish between open and closed probes but dont limit yourself to only 
these two 
Open probes are used to get the customer talking to divulge information and to perhaps reveal 
unexpected information They get the prospect to explain and talk openly about their business and 
current situation Open probes generate a talkative conversational response Some authors suggest the 
five Ws who what where when or why are good open questions to start with I disagree I consider 
them closed questions that can often be answered with one or twoword answers I offer the following 
open probe prompts 

 
Tell me about  
 
Explain to me  
 
In what way  
 
Help me understand  
 
Can you elaborate  
 
Share with me  
 
Please tell me how  
 
How else  
 
What do you mean by  
 
What are your thoughtsideasexperiencesreflections  
 
If you could build or design the perfect  what would it look like   
These are excellent fieldtested prompts used to encourage a talkative response Simply tell your 
customer up front that you need to ask questions to better understand their business Customers love 
to talk about their business their job and their company You cant ask too many questions However 
if your customer becomes impatient with your questioning simply restate your objective and perhaps 
reschedule another appointment Dont let their anxiousness draw you into a response before you 
understand their business Be patient 
Closed probes are used to get very specific information They usually limit the response to oneword 
answers Closed probes are less powerful and have an uncanny ability to increase tension They can be 
intimidating to certain personality styles The other concern is that they end the conversation Once a 
closed probe is answered you have to start another conversation Closed probes should only be used for 
verification commitment or confirming closing Examples of closed prompts include the words 

 
do 
 
have 
 
are 
 
will 
 
wont 
 
can 
 
cant 
 
shall 
An excellent strategy to help identify the decision maker the bag of money is to use these three 
closed probes when talking with your customer or with senior management 

 Do you Does X make the decisions 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

 Do you Does X have a budget 
 Do you Does X talk with anyone else prior to a decision 
My experience shows that the customer will answer yes to the first two questions but introduce a 
second party when asked the third question This is a red flag because the additional person is often 
the final decision maker You must understand who is involved and how the final decision is made Your 
objective now is to get an audience with that person hopefully with the support of your initial contact 
This simple strategy is so overlooked and yet effective that it alone will help increase your close ratio 
We often waste a lot of time by getting sucked into dealing with the wrong people people who think 
they have the final authority to purchase 
Reflective probes are used to identify personal biases of the customer which is exactly what you want 
Customers often answer questions with an eye to the corporation answering with the best interests of 
the corporation in mind However you need to differentiate yourself by understanding and satisfying the 
personal biases and preferences of the buyer the bag of money Reflective probes are very effective for 
drawing out background information personal feelings and opinions To get past common corporate 
responses ask uncommon questions Design specific reflective probes that encourage your customer 
to tell you things not told to the competition The decision to buy from you will be based on satisfying 
both corporate needs as well as personal biases and preferences Your customer can decide on vendor 
A or B both are capable of doing a good job but the final decision comes down to which vendor 
recognized and satisfied all aspects of their decision For example the customer may only have two 
years experience with the current company but  years experience in the industry You want to tap 
into his or her total experience That information can help you design a solution that satisfies both 
corporate needs and personal biases In the training business role playing is a good examplesome 
customers like them and some are biased against feeling they are too artificial and ineffective Know the 
human side of your customer The key is to recognize your customers work experience and ask 
welldesigned reflective probes Reflective probes include the words 

 
feel 
 
opinion 
 
perception 
 
sense 
 
personally 
 
aware 
 
belief 
 
view 
 
experience 
 
previous 
Examples include What are your personal feelings about    or What is your perception of  or 
What is your previous experience with  A favorite of mine is If it were your company what would 
you do That usually gets them going 

Youll be amazed at the unexpected responses yet pleased with the helpful information reflective 
probes reveal 
Conversational probes represent a style of questioning that is gaining in popularity I have been 
experimenting with conversational probes and along with other sales entrepreneurs I have found that its 
a much more relaxed natural approach Conversational probes are used to start encourage and 
maintain a normal conversation The questions themselves are not anything special or unique but I 
suggest its a matter of using a mixture of open closed and reflective probes while pursing a normal 
conversation 

Quite frankly I suggest you quit worrying about labeling your probes opened or closed and simply ask 
your customer a series of smart questions and enjoy a professional social type of conversation 
Continue your conversational probes until all the customers needs and expectations have been 
explored and all the parameters to a possible solution have been covered In other words keep asking 
questions until a solution presents itself until a watt light bulb goes off in your head with a solution 
that excites both you and your customer I would suggest that in a typical sales call you should be 
asking upwards of  questions A lot of these questions are what I refer to as clarification 
questions For example if the customer responds to your What is important to you question with 
Service is important then you must clarify it by asking What does good service look like to you 
Likewise if they respond with Quality is important or Delivery is important you must clarify by asking 
exactly what they mean by quality or delivery The danger is sales representatives are far too zealous to 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

respond rather than taking the time to fully understand the customers issues Hence by using a 
combination of conversational reflective and clarification probes it doesnt take long to ask  
questions 

Should our communication strategy change when talking to a customer versus a friend or spouse It 
shouldnt Keep it simple and relaxed Ive yet to hear a salesperson say I look forward to getting home 
and asking my spouse a bunch of open and closed probes Imagine your spouse responding with 
Honey Id appreciate it if you didnt ask me so many closed probes please ask me more open 
probes Sounds a little ridiculous I agree My point is this Why be guided by a mechanical clinical 
approach to probing during the day then take a relaxed more natural social approach with friends and 
family Adapt one simple consistent approach that accommodates both business and social 
interactions You will feel a lot more confident and relaxed in both kinds of interactions 

How often has your sales manager questioned you about open or closed probes Ive yet to hear a 
sales manager ask Sounds like you had a great call Congratulations Tell me how many open and 
closed probes did you ask Who cares As if we dont have enough to think about during a sales call 
The point is you closed the sale with a winwin solution 

I appreciate that my probing approach may be unconventional but its proving to be a simple less 
stressful approach and is certainly appreciated by my customers Its a refreshing change for both 
parties 

In their unbridled enthusiasm or nervousness salespeople often overlook an important aspect of the 
discovery stageasking permission to ask questions Asking permission can be as simple as Ms 
Smith weve been able to help hundreds of companies with various training solutions We may be able 
to help you I dont know if we can or not but to determine that may I ask you a few questions 
Alternatively you might ask To make the best use of our time today Id like to ask you a few 
questions Would you mind By asking permission you help relax the situation Your customer 
becomes a willing participant in the task of finding a possible solution that makes life a little easier 

Once you have their permission which will be  of the time you now have license to proceed with 
a series of planned wellthoughtout questions The secrets to a smooth and speedy close are often 
contained in the answers Your customers answers help pinpoint the area where you may be able to 
help them Its like a game Questions unlock the secrets to closing the sale ask the right questions 
get the right information and present the right solution The quality of your questions and your 
confidence to ask them in a logical fluid sequence is what demonstrates to the potential customer that 
you are a competent professional 

Tim Commandment  


Use quality questions to unlock the secrets to confirming more sales 
Ask Am I asking enough smart questions Do I understand their needs and expectations 


As the questioning proceeds your customer is drawn more and more into the conversation because 
answering demands total attention The average person speaks at approximately  words per minute 
but can think at approximately  words per minute While you are talking feature dumping its very 
easy for the customer to listen as well as think about other things including possible objections 
problems at work or home an argument with the teenager last night missing a Visa payment or the 
prediction of rain for tomorrows  teeoff time Questions minimize mental drift and help keep control 
of the sales call The longer you talk the more opportunity the customer has to drift into another world 
However the instant you ask a question the customer snaps back to the conversation and refocuses on 
you Control lies with the person asking the questions Your goal is to do more listening than talking 
As long as youre talking youre going to hear stuff you already know Think about it To learn you must 
be silent and listen By the way silent and listen contain the same letters and I find it interesting that 
ear is found in learn and earn 

Your needs analysis will reveal one of three possible scenarios The customer is aware of your product 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

but is currently using the competition and is not interested in you the customer is unfamiliar with your 
product and shows no interest or the customer is unaware of your product but expresses an interest 
The latter is what I call creating demandintroducing a product or service never used before by an 
existing or a potential customer Demand is created by understanding the customers needs and 
presenting the product or service as a benefit to their business Customers are always on the lookout 
for a competitive edge The introduction of your product or service just might help to achieve that 
competitive edge However you must appreciate that even though you created the initial demand the 
customer may invite your competition to present their product for comparative reasons and to validate 
the legitimacy of the new product or service 


Of the three possible scenarios the first one is most common A customer has a need but is currently 
using a competitor Thus your goal is to ask carefully planned questions that encourage the customer 
to review the performance of an existing supplier Your questions may reveal some instances of poor 
service or quality Through this tactful method you do not criticize your competitor your customer does 

Some authors suggest that selling is a hurt and rescue business Find the hurt uncover the pain 
discover the problem and come to the rescue This concept suggests that the customer has been living 
with an intolerable situation and that your product or service will provide instant relief from all suffering 
Sales representatives buy into this concept thinking customers are suffering from a gaping wound that 
only their product or service will heal Wrong The reality is that your potential customer is doing just 
fine without you or your remedy for instant relief The challenge is to discover an inconvenience or 
dissatisfaction that the customer is experiencing with their existing vendor and then provide a solution 
that resolves it Even though the customer is somewhat satisfied your solution must focus on 
alleviating the inconvenience Otherwise why would they switch to you They wont 

An inconvenience is a situation that is less than ideal but your customer is prepared to tolerate it The 
customer may feel that fixing it may not be worth the effort or a different vendor might make things 
worse I suggest that it may only be an inconvenience because as I mentioned earlier your competition 
mirrors approximately  or more of your features so you know they are doing a pretty good job 
servicing the customer Very few products or services are perceived as providing a unique advantage 

Differences between competitors are much more subtle today than perhaps even five years ago Today 
we sell in an intensely competitive marketplace Enhanced competition pressures to differentiate and 
global impact have made even the best features and benefits temporary as well as tenuous Often the 
customer is left struggling to sort out the differences Remember your customers buy from you based 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

on less than  of your features Unfortunately price becomes the easiest and quickest way for a 
customer to validate differences between competitors and justify a purchase Thats why price gets the 
attention it does 

By asking a series of smart wellthoughtout questions customers will reveal clues as to the features 
that will satisfy the sale Just as in baking or cooking there must be the right mix of ingredients 
features to produce the desired results

Feature Fishing 

Now its time to go fishing Just hang on I dont mean taking the day off to head out to your favorite 
fishing hole Im referring to fishing right in the customers office verbal casting Bait the conversation 
with questions that reveal the customers needs expectations and hotbuttons Although you have 
done your precall planning on the macro issues you cannot learn intimate knowledge of your 
customers business until you engage in a conversation During this conversation your objective is to 
fish around to discover the features on your menu that may be of interest 

I offer two methods of feature fishing  Simply ask your customer whats important when considering a 
supplier What specifics is he or she looking for What are his or her expectations What makes a 
good vendor  Suggest some of your more popular features by scrolling through your menu Ask the 
customer Have you thought about  Have you considered     Did you know that     Have 
you ever used   and so on Its the same as your server in a restaurant recommending daily 
specials The answers to your probes help identify specific requirements information you wouldnt glean 
from an annual report or the receptionist Personally I prefer a combination of the two methods

Effective Bridging 

Once you have identified the appropriate features and the hotbuttons its time to bridge Bridging 
occurs when you link the feature to the benefit Each feature offers several potential benefits that must 
be explained in detail for the customer to fully appreciate it as a benefit In the end the customer 
decides if the feature is in fact a benefit Remember customers buy benefits not features Features on 
their own represent the sowhat information I spoke of earlier Dont feature dump 

Although this book is not about scripts and rigid steps to follow I do suggest you consider this very 
short succinct script while you get comfortable with bridging The benefit to you is  These five words 
verbally initiate the bridge taking a feature to a benefit Once the feature is bridged to a benefit confirm 
its acceptance by asking Do you see this feature as a benefit to you and your business If your 
customer agrees you have successfully bridged the feature and anchored it as a benefit The following 
diagram illustrates bridging 


The above illustration represents the three steps of effective bridging 

Step  In conversation with your customer features 
  and  were identified as hotbuttons 
relevant features The other features proved 
to be of little interest sowhat information 
Continue to verbally scroll your menu until 
you have identified three or four features of 
interest 
Step  Bridge appropriate features using the 
statement The benefit to you is  This 
statement ensures your customer is 
thinking in terms of benefits Go on to 
explain the benefits of the feature in terms of 
your customers specific requirements and 
how the benefits relate to his or her needs 
Step  Validate the customers acceptance of the 
benefits by asking Do you see this 
feature as a benefit If yes you have 
benefits 

Bridging is a fundamental ingredient of a successful call When followed the three steps eliminate the 
monotony of feature dumping identify a tailored solution shorten the sales cycle and show customers 
how you can help their business Benefits sell features tell

Inverse Bridging 

Inverse bridging occurs when you start with a benefit and bridge it back to the supporting feature This 
approach says to the customer This is what we can do for you benefit and this is how we do it 
feature This is an excellent strategy to make a telephone appointment to create demand in a new or 
existing account or to gain interest when making cold calls Customers frequently challenge 
salespeople by demanding Why should I see you or How can you help my business or Im too 
busy call me in three months Sound familiar When on the telephone the challenge is to get the 
customers attention quickly and sell the appointment Features rarely get attention quickly but by 
stating a benefit right up front you may bait the prospect enough to stimulate mild curiosity The 
question is what benefits do you use to stimulate interest My advice is to use the benefits that have 
proven popular with current customers Do some research Know the benefits of your product or service 
that are consistently accepted by your customer base Alternatively offer a benefit that you know will 
directly impact your customers business Remember it is the customer who validates your benefit so 
dont be shocked if they reject your initial attempt at inverse bridging If they do simply acknowledge 
their indifference and suggest other benefits that may be more relevant The objective with inverse 
bridging is not to sell them but to gain access The following illustration shows inverse bridging 


Every salesperson at some point in time has experienced the frustration of trying to make 
appointments One approach that has proven effective is to suggest to the potential customer during the 
initial telephone conversation that you may not have anything to sell him or her If they ask What are 
you going to sell me simply respond with At this point Im not suremaybe nothing However what 
I would like is  minutes of your time to explore the possibility of our companies doing business The 
very suggestion that you are not trying to sell them something will get the customers attention They 
will feel more relaxed about granting you an appointment The use of inverse bridging and the maybe 
nothing statement is a potent combination that will increase your success with firsttime appointments 
Participants at my seminars agree that this approach is unconventional but they recognize how it can 
be immensely effective

Avoid the Penalty Box 

The penalty box is a very crowded impoverished place where sales representatives frequently find 
themselves However a visit to the penalty box can easily go undetected The problem is twofold Sales 
representatives not only dont realize theyre there or worse they dont know why they were sent there 
A visit to the penalty box occurs when the salesperson has relinquished control of the sales call by 
immediately answering the customers question Salespeople tend to answer questions too quickly 
failing to determine why the question was asked in the first place Have you ever stopped to wonder why 
a customer is asking you a question If you remove your assumptions the answer is I dont know why 
he asked that You run the danger of committing to an answer prior to understanding the customers 
reason for asking it Eagerly answering all his questions immediately can have dire consequences to 
the outcome of a sales call 
You can maintain control of the sales call by answering highimpact questions with a question 
Customers usually have a good reason for asking a question so its in your best interest to find out 
why What might be in the back of their minds Whats the motivation behind the question Jumping on 
the question with a quick clever answer simply gives up control You are totally at the mercy of the 
customers interpretation of your answer A visit to the penalty box is one of the biggest reasons 
salespeople lose sales 

The problem stems from the process we were taught in our educational system We were conditioned 
by our teachers and parents to Just answer the question In class we were taught to raise our hand 
and spit out an answer When answered correctly it fueled selfesteem and heightened our confidence 
especially in the presence of our classmates and our teachers Sales entrepreneurs have learned to 
resist the temptation to immediately respond to questions but rather to inquire about the reason for 
asking I offer this fivestep strategy to help you safeguard yourself against unproductive time spent in 
the penalty box 

 
Identify the question as either high impact or low impact Ask What impact will 
my answer have on the buying decision A highimpact question means your answer 
will either negatively or positively impact the customers decision to buy from you You 
must listen carefully to the question put it in the context of the conversation and 
decide on your answers impact If high impact go to Step  If low impact simply 
answer the question 
 
Compliment their questionmake them feel good Thank them for asking you a 
good question one that perhaps you havent heard before It may have been asked 
because of its importance or relevancy to the situation but you wont know until you 
ask In any case be sure to acknowledge the question as a good one 
 
Identify the agenda Why is the customer asking the question At this point only the 
customer knows Politely probe the reason for asking You need to be delicate with this 
because you dont want to appear confrontational by blurting out Why do you ask 
Your response should sound like this Thats a good question Ive never been asked 
that before Would you share with me your reason for asking Articulate your response 
to the question using your own words your own style The customer will usually share 
some thoughts helping you pinpoint exact concerns 
Echoing can also be an effective method to reveal your customers hidden agenda When the 
customer finishes asking a question simply repeat or echo a couple of key words from the 
question For example a customer says Your delivery schedule seems to be too long 
Your respond with Too long Your echo will stimulate a response 
 
Bridge Now that you understand the customers reason for asking bridge the 
appropriate feature to the benefit For example if he were curious or uncertain about 
delivery and Step  revealed that he wants rush deliveries when required you can scroll 
your features menu and pick one that best satisfies that particular need then bridge it 
as a benefit 
 
Verify Ask the customer Have I answered your question Have I addressed your 
concern Do not press forward with the sales call until you have satisfied his concern 
Earning the right to advance means leaving behind no unresolved questions concerns 
or objections 
To illustrate the five steps lets look at a fairly typical scenario A relatively new salesperson is calling 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

on a potential A account who is doing business with the salespersons biggest competitor Midway 

through the sales call the customer asks 
C How long have you been in the industry 
highimpact question 
S Thats a good question that Im often asked 
and Ill be happy to answer it Is experience 
something you are looking for in a 
salesperson 
C Yes it is I want someone with no fewer than 
 to  years of industry experience Our 
business is unique and we rely on our 
suppliers to keep us current with industry 
trends and new technologies 
S Although Ive only been in the business for 
two years I have a wealth of knowledge and 
support at the office In fact our group 
represents over  manyears of 
experience The benefit to you is that as 
your salesperson I can put that experience 
to work for you 
C True enough I didnt consider things from 
that angle 
S Have I addressed your concern 
C Yes that makes sense 

You have now earned the right to continue The response was both honest and right These five steps 
should only serve as a guideline to managing the sales dialogue The concept of answering a question 
with a question is not new its been around for decades However I am simply packaging the process 
in a professional manageable format The objective is to foster appreciation and respect for your 
customers question take a moment to pause and consider why it is being asked Even when you 
provide an honest answer it may not be the right one Of course all of your answers will be honest but 
are they the best answers There is a big difference Our answers must align themselves with the 
customers agenda Im not suggesting that avoiding the penalty box is a new sales gimmick or a 
manipulative maneuver its not Its simply an effective tactic to synchronize the call Now take a 
moment and imagine the consequences of just blurting out an honest answer 

C 
How long have you been in the industry 

S 
Two years I started just after we moved into 
our new building 

C 
Really 

S 
Yeah so let me just finish up what I was 
talking to you about 

Although the answer of two years is honest it was the wrong one The customer now tells you Well 
thanks for coming by Ive got your brochures and pricing well keep you on file You just got sent to 
the penalty box and chances are you have no idea why Customers interpret your answers based on 
their biases and perceptions In this case the customer hears the answer two years and interprets 
that as having no experience It was honest but wrong Honesty and right must work together you cant 
have one without the other otherwise youre in the penalty box If nothing else this concept will 
heighten your awareness of how important it is to pay attention to customers questions and avoid the 
penalty box

Communication Skills 

Effective communication is essential for a successful sale but is probably one of the most overlooked 
underdeveloped skills in professional selling We cannot take communication for granted simply 
because we are fluent in the English languagebut we do The cornerstone of effective communication 
is sensitivity to the needs of others It begins with an understanding of the communication process 
Encoding occurs when a sender translates thoughts into a message The receiver must decode the 
message and try to understand what the sender intended to communicate Communication is effective 
only when the receiver accurately understands what the sender intended to transmit Its not uncommon 
to hear someone say Yeah but thats not what I meant or I thought you said this  

Communication in selling involves more than presenting your product or service it involves an active 
twoway exchange of ideas and thoughts However research suggests that in most calls salespeople 
do up to  of the talking  Wrong thing to do Remember PEZ Please Excuse my Zealousness 
We often think of ourselves as good communicators because we have the gift of the gab I know of 
several people who were encouraged to pursue a career in sales because they were great talkers We 
equate speaking with control and power assuming the spotlight is focused on the talkers rather than 
the listeners Our society recognizes and rewards great orators actors singers public speakers and 
news commentators who excel at oneway communication There are lots of books and seminars on 
developing public speaking skills but when did you ever hear of a seminar on public listening skills 
They dont exist Unfortunately listening is not the sexy part of the communication model I would 
suggest that the biggest violation of the communication model is poor listening skills

Why We Are Poor Listeners 

Lazy listening is enormously costly to our success Most of us think we are good listeners but that 
overconfidence may be the reason for our downfall Nothing puts a sales call in jeopardy faster than 
poor inattentive listening Customers dont take long to get a sense of your listening commitment 
especially given the fact that  of communication is nonverbal  Thats right  About  is 
through obvious body language and  is by how you say it  Given these overwhelming statistics 
its pretty tough to convince the customer that you are listening if in fact youre not 

We listen at about  of our potential We miss ignore forget distort or misunderstand  of what 
we hear Hard to believe perhaps but true Given these statistics we can see why communication 
breaks down so quickly The receiver is responding to only  of the senders message  Thats why 
during my seminars I suggest that In most cases communication is not part of the conversation 
Such lazy listening habits are very costly to both your business and your personal success 

Improvement begins with an understanding of why people have a natural tendency to be poor listeners 
Rather than have you put this book down and promise aloud I will be a better listener I offer you the 
four reasons why we are poor listeners 

 
Our predominant thoughts focus on ourselves and sex We think of ourselves  
hours a dayhow we look feel our personal problems and successes work and so 
on Even while we sleep Did you ever have a dream where you werent in it Probably 
not We see ourselves as the most important element of our lives followed by a natural 
attraction to sex Psychologists agree that on average we think of sex consciously or 
unconsciously every two and a half minutes We were put on this planet to reproduce 
so thank goodness He made it fun Maslows hierarchy of needs theory reinforces this 
concept along with our overwhelming need to be loved and accepted People will go to 
great lengths to satisfy those needs Its no wonder we are poor listeners when sitting 
with our customers Our agendas usually take precedence over theirs 
 
Our minds wander Our minds think approximately eight times faster than we talk 
We normally speak at approximately  words per minute we listen and understand 
at up to  words per minute and we can think at  words per minute 
Unbelievable but true Heres the dilemma our customers talk to us at  words per 
minute and we think at  words per minute Mental drift is too easy and often 
results in minimal communication during a conversation Clearly it takes tremendous 
discipline to stay focused on the customers message By the way your customers 
also experience mental drift at a speed of  words per minute Chances are good 
that during a feature dump their minds will wander off somewhere else perhaps Jamaica 
or Barbados 
 
We cant wait to reply Our unbridled enthusiasm to reply sabotages the 
communication model We often listen with the sole intent to reply At the expense of 
effective listening we formulate a response at a speed of  words per minute 
before the sender has completed commenting The second they finish speaking we 
jump in with what we think is a valid appropriate response Our quick response is 
further fueled by our perceptions and biases as we attempt to decode their message 
When you jump in with your quick response it clearly communicates to the sender that 
you were not listening that you were more concerned with your reply rather than 
understanding the message It can be very frustrating and irritating when you know the 
listener is not paying attention and is preoccupied with formulating a response 
Listening is a lot easier when you like the person and agree with the message The most 

difficult time to listen is when you disagree with what youre seeing or hearing Under those 

conditions many listeners arent listening at alltheyre preoccupied with drafting a rebuttal 

The challenge is to put personal feelings aside and focus on the message As with effective 

negotiation deal with the issues not the personalities 

A suggestion to help overcome your tendency to offer an immediate reply is to wait two to 
three seconds before you reply Let the sender finish her comments look her in the eye 
acknowledge her input with a nod or a verbal sign then reply The big plus is that if you wait 
a moment your customer may start talking again and yes thats a good thing 

 
We interrupta lot Everybody has an opinion and loves to get his two cents worth in 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

Even if we arent asked we willingly lend our views and comments thinking that we are 
making a significant contribution Over the years we have been conditioned to interrupt 
or we may not get a chance to share our views which of course are critical if the 
conversation is going to have any substance What fuels our need to interrupt is that we 
are always thinking of self or sex and we can do it at  words per minute With this 
lethal combination its no wonder we are poor listeners 

Effective listening means more than refraining from the bad habit of interrupting Good listening means 
being satisfied to listen to the entire message rather than waiting impatiently to jump in with your 
response 
My informal research suggests that a conversation wont last longer than  to  seconds before an 
interruption occurssomeone jumping in with a story another view However in a sales call it can be 
advantageous to interrupt with questions that clarify your understanding of the situation I refer to this as 
productive interruption Customers are tolerant of clarification questions because the focus remains on 
them and you are showing interest 

To further demonstrate your commitment to the customer and to improve your listening skills be sure to 
take notes during the sales call There is no way you will remember all the details and issues you 
discussed In regard to notetaking protocol be sure to ask permission to take notes when you are in 
the customers office Its polite respectful and your nonverbal message is This meeting is important 
so I need to take some notes If you are in the neutral territory of a boardroom or a meeting room you 
do not need permission However ask anyway If the customer is getting ahead of you and your 
notetaking simply interrupt the customer by saying Thats a great point let me make a note of that 
The customer will be happy to give you a few seconds to complete your notes At the end of the 
meeting you might consider summarizing the important points You can preface this with As I 
understand it    

When you improve your listening skills you hold a competitive edge Lucky for you listening gets scant 
recognition by your competitors As we know listening is not strongly identified in selling and you are 
not likely to be outlistened by the competition Theyre too busy trying to get the customer to listen

Congratulations you have now completed Step

Chapter  Presentation Skills ValueAdded 
Solutions 


Congratulations on another graduation You have successfully worked through the first five steps of the 
Sequential Model doing the groundwork to meet and exceed your customers expectations This next 
step applies to potential new customers as well as existing customers to whom you are presenting a 
new product or service 
So what is a valueadded solution It means enhancing your solution by exceeding the expectations of 
your customers It means going outside the traditional role of a sales representative to provide a solution 
that truly elevates you above your closest competitor Customers buy differences not similarities The 
challenge is finding innovative unique ways to exceed expectations Cookiecutter solutions and boring 
hohum presentations are all too common As Larry Wilson writes in his book Changing the Game 
Instead of trying to find prospects who fit my presentation what I needed to do was fit my presentation 
to the prospect I found  A simple idea but it changed selling for me Unfortunately for customers 
sales representatives continue to try to fit them into canned rehearsed presentations Or they try to 
close the sale based on price instead of offering a valueadded solution Sadly enough customers are 
often saddled with the burden of trying to differentiate among proposals that imitate each othermetoo 
cookiecutter solutions that seduce customers with little more than the lowest price Your responsibility 
is to make it easy for your customer to decide to remove the stress of uncertainty 

Why Should I Buy From You 

Why should I buy from you is a universal question one that stalls the call and puts salespeople 
into a tailspin struggling with a response that does little to excite the customer Ive seen it happen far 
too often Openly challenged the salesperson retreats deep into his or her comfort zone responding 
with a wellrehearsed feature dump hoping to avoid a crash and burn situation We know the result all 
too well Another presentation ending in tragedy another lost sale 
The Why should I buy from you question needs to be answered with a wellprepared presentation 
that addresses the benefits of both parties doing business together Your success relies on how well 
you probed identified expectations and then satisfied those expectations by presenting the attributes 
your company can offer Dont make the alltoocommon mistake of telling your story from your point of 
view but rather present your story from the customers point of view You must weave appropriate 
benefits into your presentation so that customers clearly see your solution as helping their business run 
more efficiently True story Two gentlemen were getting their hair cut Person A was a VP at a large oil 
company and person B was the president of a different company Person A knew B and introduced 
himself and his company saying My people were recently in to see your people Person B responded 
by saying in his Texas accent Thats interesting What youall goin to do for us I couldnt have said 
it any better myself Customers expect innovative valueadded solutions that become assets to their 
business If you are doing a good job you should be aware of your customers expectations Your 
presentation does not happen in isolation It is supported by the first five steps of the Sequential Model 
including a thorough Discovery step earning the right to present Remember your model allows for no 
missing pieces

Neutralize the Competition 

Creative sellers get the sale and the gold medal Through effective Discovery sales entrepreneurs work 
with customers to present creative solutions that exceed expectations Exceeding is the key the 
essence of a convincing presentation If you simply meet their expectations thats just doing your job 
no big deal so what Sales entrepreneurs ask themselves How can I use my imagination and 
creativity to make a vivid impression on my customer How can I make my presentation different and 
stronger Eliminate routine boring predictable presentations Chances are your customer has 
endured hundreds of metoo presentations so make yours different make it fun The key to neutralizing 
your competition is innovation 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Ten Key Ingredients 

To help you differentiate yourself and neutralize the competition I offer ten key ingredients of an 
effective creative presentation They apply whether you are presenting to an individual a committee or 
a group 

 
Enjoy Yourself Enjoy what you are doing Selling is fun not a battle of wits between 
customer and salesperson so loosen up and enjoy Believe in yourself and what you 
are selling supported by the right mental attitude Add your own style of enthusiasm 
and be somewhat entertaining as well as informative After all you are on stage 
Communicate your belief in yourself and your product or service by exhibiting sincere 
enthusiasm Involve your customer when and if appropriate I tell my customers that I 
sell entertrainment At my seminars youre going to learn something but you will have 
fun in the process When was the last time you learned something that was boring or 
presented in lackluster fashion You probably haventboredom stifles learning 
Rekindle your enthusiasm if necessary and present with gusto 
Another aspect of enjoying yourself is looking good feeling good I often suggest the most 
important presentation of the day is to yourself in the mirror You must be confident of your 
appearance prior to a confident delivery People love to visualize and the visual sense is 
very very powerful In fact it is the visual impression that makes the greatest impact 
Remember people buy you with their eyes within  seconds As a result our verbal 
content can be virtually smothered by the vocal and visual components 
Research suggests that the believability of a message is evaluated on three elements  
percent verbal  percent vocal and  percent visual  What you do speaks so loud I 
cant hear what you say Great words spoken by Ralph Emerson 
The fun of it all begins with the process of looking and feeling good Don your best outfit fill 
your lungs with confidence and within ten seconds your audience will be impressed with 
your presentation 
 
Prepare and prepare some more Preparation is key to a smooth fluid presentation 
Any good seminar on presentation skills will tell you Dont try to eliminate the 
butterflies simply get them to fly in formation Having the butterflies is a form of 
positive energy that will help you get started and make a smooth transition into the 
body of your presentation Here is a guideline that I use Every five minutes of 
presentation time requires one hour of preparation time Thus a minute presentation 
requires a minimum of three hours preparation Trust me this formula works As one 
anonymous quote suggests Every time you open your mouth your mind is on 
parade Preparation will ensure your parade looks sharp sounds sharp and dazzles 
your audience Make it fresh not canned 
Another suggestion is to rehearse your presentation by delivering it aloud to a wall Pick a 
quiet place perhaps at home stand back from a wall then go through your presentation at 
least the verbal part If you do it a couple of times to the wall youll be amazed how easy it 
is when you do it live 
As a professional keynote speaker I spend days preparing for a halfday keynote Here is 
another guideline Be cognizant of when you prepare Dont use valuable selling hours to do 
your homework I refer you back to Tim Commandment  in Chapter  page  

 
Know your customers style type Consider how you might design your presentation 
to appeal to different style types A presentation to a Director should be totally different 
than to a Socializer or a Thinker Each style has different expectations that cannot be 
ignored Chapter  
Socializer Must be fun entertaining and stimulating Sell sizzle more than steak Make 
your presentation colorful and upbeat showing how your product or service will enhance your 
customers status and visibility 
Director Must be short to the point businesslike outlining the main points Time will be 
limited so dont waste it with unnecessary conversation or detail Present the facts and the 
results they can expect to see Give them options where they can make decisions 
Thinker Must be logical informative and detailoriented Thinkers are very analytical 
looking for accurate information honesty and reliability Back up your presentation with 
supportive documentation and data and a lot of technological punch Dont expect a decision 
that day Thinkers need time to mull it over working out any possible bugs Arrange a 

ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

specific time to follow up 
Relater Must be sensitive to the people side of the business Ask for opinions and feelings 
and show how your solution will be compatible with other departments within the company 
Use lots of references and testimonials Relaters need to know that other customers support 
your product or service They tend to follow the norm guided by routine so dont make your 
solution too bizarre or outlandish 

When presenting to a committee or to more than one individual tailor your presentation to 
the style type of the decision maker among the group Identify who the key individual is prior 
to the meeting and design your presentation and your approach to reflect his or her style 
You cannot be all things to all people so dont even try It makes for a very awkward 
presentation if you try to satisfy everyone by floating among the four styles I caution you 
Dont present until you have determined who will be there and why Dont ever go into a 
presentation blind do your homework If you cant meet committee members prior to the 
presentation at least talk to them on the phone to determine their style and their role in the 
decisionmaking process 

 
Involve the senses A Chinese proverb says Tell me Ill forget Show me I may 
remember Involve me Ill understand Up to  of what we learn is through sight 
Take advantage of these findings and include visuals where you can within reason The 
more senses you can engage in your presentation the bettervisual auditory or 
kinesthetic touch it feel it Research demonstrates that visual input makes the 
greatest impact Psychologists agree that viewing something three times has a lasting 
impression and improves retention and recall However dont show up to your next 
presentation with  overheads colorfully presented on PowerPoint 
 
Be benefitoriented People dont buy what something is they buy what something 
does Avoid presenting your features they do nothing to stimulate the customer into 
action Benefits will By talking about benefits you keep your customers attention 
focused on the whats in it for me aspect A sobering thought to consider when 
presenting Your average customers will immediately forget  of what you told them 
and after only  hours will forget up to  of your message Ouch All the more 
reason to captivate your customers attention by using all their senses presenting 
benefits and having fun 
 
Avoid corporate jargon Nothing loses customers faster than confusion Dont use 
gobbledegook that may confuse them use their language and their lingo and provide 
explanations where appropriate My suggestion is to present simple concepts first then 
complex ones later in the presentation Presenting simple concepts early will help warm 
the audience to your style and make it easier for them to understand the complex ones 
later Customers are sceptical of razzledazzle presentations straightforwardness and 
honesty should be your guideposts 
 
Exceed expectations The first step is to know what  is then exceed it Know 
what your customer expects from you You only learn that by asking Unless you 
clearly understand what the  mark is you run the risk of delivering a solution that 
falls short of expectations Delivering a solution that you are excited about does little to 
advance the sale if it is only at  of customers expectations Once again that may 
be the reason you get beat up on price A  solution doesnt cut it not nowadays 
To exceed expectations you only have to go an extra inch not an extra mile All it takes is 
a little extra effort giving customers something they didnt expect Exceed expectations by 
delivering an extra unexpected  The  solution It really doesnt take much to exceed 
expectations Just as little things can turn a customer off little things will turn a customer 
on An example of a  solution would be just as you are leaving the store with your new 
CD player the salesperson you dealt with stops you at the door and says Thank you for 
your business I appreciate it Why dont you go over to the rack and pick out a free CD of 
your choice Its on me Would that impress you No doubt it would The potential return on 
positive word of mouth is certainly worth the investment of giving away a free CD Keep in 
mind though no two customers are alike Not every customer will appreciate a free CD so 
you will need to vary your  solutions Each customer comes with a unique set of 
expectations and perceptions that must be revealed during the Discovery step It stands to 
reason then that no two presentations or solutions will be the same I suggest that from 
now on you deliver a solution that is  of expectationsunderpromise and overdeliver 
Dont simply satisfy your customerssurprise them 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

 
Be professional Your only option as a sales entrepreneur is to be guided by a 
professional code of conduct walk the talk It is critical that your verbal presentation be 
in sync with your visual presentation That means sound professional and look 
professional Dont show up looking like a bum but sounding like a pro or vice versa 
Also use professional language dont swear or use slang Even if your customer is 
using colorful superlatives dont lower yourself Maintain a level of conduct that says 
you are a professional a true sales entrepreneur Yes be yourself but dont engage in 
activity or conversation that erodes your credibility or your professional conduct Also 
be consistent Customers are sceptical and suspicious of inconsistent behavior You 
have worked hard to get to the presentation stage Dont blow it by being inconsistent 
throughout the sales process The Sequential Model demands professional consistency 
at every stepno missing pieces 
 
Take the customer to the presentation Rather than struggling to take all your stuff 
to your customers it can be easier and a bit more exciting to take your customers out 
of the office on a field trip Take them on a tour of your facility or perhaps show them 
your product already in use at one of your other customers locations I have known 
salespeople who have flown potential customers to tour their head office and meet the 
president and some of the personnel who will be involved in servicing them Once again 
most people are visual so take advantage of that and show them anytime you get the 
chance Its worth the trip and the investment 
This approach also communicates pride and clearly demonstrates your commitment to the 
relationship as well as the conviction that your solution is right for them 

 
Action plan Dont limit your role to that of a presenter As an entrepreneur you are 
there to present an entire package which includes a next stepan action plan Dont 
finish with Thanks for having me in Ill call you next week Ask for feedback then 
determine a specific call to action This could be a specific day and time to follow up 
an appointment for a followup visit a tour a meeting with the design people and so on 
Dont leave empty handed

Managing Objections Friend or Foe 

If only my customers would quit raising objections selling would be a lot easier No doubt this 
statement reflects the thoughts of many sales representatives especially those with limited experience 
One thing is certain about objections they have a nasty habit of popping out of nowhere during the 
sales call They can appear anywhere at any time and usually without warning Nothing strikes fear in 
a sales representatives eyes faster than an unexpected objection 

Selling today involves an array of sophisticated skills Many sales experts agree that the moment of 
truth of closing wont happen until you have listened to understood and successfully resolved any 
objections the customer has Overcoming objections is your ticket to sales successthe gold medal 
Objections are strange things Most objections are really questions or concerns in disguise They are 
often smoke screens protecting the customer against possible buyers remorse or the wrath of 
management for making a wrong purchasing decision Although the customer may be totally honest 
and sincere you may not clearly understand what the concern is 

Sales representatives view objections as the enemy as traps that customers set to sabotage the sale 
and get rid of them Sales representatives feel challenged by objections because they require an 
onthespot unrehearsed response possibly derailing their wellrehearsed canned pitch You never 
know what the customer might object to or challenge you about However objections are an integral 
part of the whole business of selling Without objections youd be just an ordertaker The career 
opportunities for professional ordertakers are dismal and the pay is about the same 
I suggest that wellprepared sales entrepreneurs anticipate and welcome objections They have learned 
the value of objections and view them as a friend an ally to the conversation This means that managing 
objections should be planned for just as with any other step of your Sequential Model Rather than 
regard an objection as an obstacle regard it as an asset to the sale It depends on your attitude Even 
though objections tend to sound like verbal attacks you cant afford to have your response sound 
defensive or confrontational With a positive attitude youre more likely to respond without any hint of 
hostility which makes your customer more receptive A positive attitude can be communicated by use 
of a cushioning statement an empathy statement such as Youre right our price is higher than most 
but what exactly is your concern This helps build rapport and encourages trust Remember it is your 
reaction to the objection that counts not the objection itself 

Give some thought as to how you view objections How do you respond to objections Whats your 
attitude Youre on the right track if upon hearing an objection your immediate response is to ask 
yourself What exactly does the customer mean by that If theres any doubt and often there is dont 
assume simply clarify the concern in one of these ways 

 
What do you mean by that 
 
Is this what you mean 
 
Tell me more 
 
Please elaborate 
 
Im not sure I understand 
The cardinal rule for managing objections is Never offer a response to an objection until you fully 
understand how it relates to this particular customer and this particular situation 
The cause of objections is somewhat universal Its an uneasiness brought on by unsatisfied 
unanswered or undeveloped expectations Remove the cause of an objection and you remove the 
concern Objections may stem from political reasons my sister works for your competitor personal 
biases I prefer to deal with XYZ company or from prejudices Ive heard bad things about your 
company Most however come from unsatisfied personal or corporate expectations The probing skills 
developed in Chapter  will help you explore customer expectations We all feel uneasy about 
purchasing something that hasnt dealt with all of our concerns and expectations voiced or unvoiced 
Its impossible to effectively anticipate all possible objections Objections are as varied as customers 
themselves I suggest you develop strategies responses for the more common objections you may 
encounter 
However objections are good barometers for the sales call They show your customer is listening and 
they provide a means of clarification while stimulating conversation Simply consider objections as 
conversational speed bumps slowing you down long enough to grasp what the customers concerns 
are Look at each objection as a spotlight on a particular concern Once satisfactorily resolved each 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

grants you the right to advance the sale Objections are also a means for customers to direct the 
conversation in line with their expectations They offer a huge communication advantage Rather than 
you yacking aimlessly feature dumping customer objections provide navigational signposts guiding 
you where the conversation needs to go It helps both of you stay in sync and helps shrink the sales 
cycle The absencenot the presenceof objections should be cause for concern One of the surest 
signs of a bad or deteriorating relationship is the absence of objections The customer is either bored 
not being candid or is simply not interested 
It is important however to draw a distinction between objections and tough questions The difference 
can be significant yet subtle Objections are expressed in response to a comment or information you 
provided A tough question is asked to retrieve information from you Treat the tough question as just 
that a question to gain new information Be straightforward and provide specific information that directly 
answers the question For example the customer might raise an objection right after you bridged a 
feature challenging you to further validate the benefit whereas a tough question may deal with a 
potentially difficult situation that many sales people mistakenly interpret as an objection The customer 
will either be satisfied with your answer ask another question or generate a new objection In either 
case know the difference and employ the appropriate response

FiveStep Strategy 

Lets look at an appropriate response to managing objections guided by the fivestep strategy 

 
Acknowledge and validate your customers objections Dont stick your head in the 
sand and hope they go away or the customer forgets about them Even postponement 
of the objection may result in a negative perception or reaction from your customer 
Some sales seminars have suggested that it is best to ignore the objection that its 
only important if the customer brings it up more than once Wrong The next time they 
think of it may be after youve left and your competitor is in the customers office more 
than happy to address the very objection you ignored Show respect and empathy by 
immediately acknowledging the concern Simply say Yes I can understand your 
concern or Other customers initially felt the same way or Thats a fairly common 
concern in our business I will be happy to address it Remember always express 
empathy and sincerity and never get defensive Watch your nonverbal responses as 
well Turn the objections into positives by regarding them as gateways into your 
customers thought process Objections are really just your customer voicing concerns 
and explaining primary expectations and needs Be sure to hear between the lines 
Take the time to think about what is being said and the way it is being said Sales 
representatives too often leap on an objection before the customer has had a chance to 
finish talking The customer barely gets ten words out and the sales representative is 
already hammering away at a defensive response I have to show hes mistaken how 
could he be so misinformed Its a panicky reaction that often sabotages the sale and 
the relationship The best defense is a good professional offense 
 
Clarify your customers specific objection Paraphrase with questions that help you 
understand the objection Though some customers are adept at voicing needs as 
needs others voice their needs as objections All objections can be used to your 
advantage once you realize that you are gaining valuable information 
Identify their objection as either factual based on logic or emotional based on personal 
perception and biases Objections are usually motivated by one or the other Factual 
objections are much easier to deal with because incorrect information or incorrect 
perceptions can be corrected Facts are objective universal and inarguable Emotional 
objections however are extremely difficult to deal with They are subjective and often merely 
an excuse or smoke screen They usually dont follow sound reasoning and may take 
patience and persistence to overcome They sometimes conceal a hidden concern that you 
may never be privy to Once again effective use of conversational probes will eventually get 
you to the root cause of the objection As you ask questions stay relaxed listen carefully 
take notes and appreciate that youre about to learn something important As a last resort 
the eventual resolution may have to be to flag it as a C account and move on 
 
Respond to the objection immediately and solve the problem It represents the 
customers predominant thought at the moment so make it yours Remember your 
customer is probably expressing legitimate corporate curiosity not launching a 
personal attack on you 
Satisfying the customers objection or concern may be as simple as mentally scrolling down 
your menu of features and presenting the one that will eliminate the objection The 
feelfeltfound method is an effective strategy to manage objections The sequence is 
important and should sound like this I can understand how you feel  other customers felt 
the same way    but once onboard with us this is what they found    Provide details 
about how other customers benefited from their decision to buy from you A testimonial letter 
may strengthen your case You can actually demonstrate that other customers realized their 
initial opinions were unfounded after they tried your product This is an excellent method 
especially for Socializers and Relators because they tend to care what other people think 
 
Validate that the objection has been satisfied Dont assume that you have satisfied 
the customers concern There is nothing worse than plowing through the sale leaving 
behind unresolved unanswered objections If you dont resolve them your competitor 
will 
To validate acceptance of your response simply ask the customer Have I satisfied your 
concern By answering yes the customer grants you permission to carry on with the sale 
A no answer may indicate that further clarification is necessary

Uncover objections up front Sales entrepreneurs know that certain features of their 
product or service may be vulnerable to the competition Although not all objections can 
be preempted the more common ones can be addressed during the conversation Bring 
it up before the customer does A sales entrepreneur may approach the price issue by 
saying Other customers have expressed concern that our product is expensive Well 
let me show you the true value in relation to the cost You now go on to bridge the 
appropriate features to benefits Customers have no need to raise objections already 
stated and answered by the salesperson This strategy will help thwart possible false or 
shallow objections that may stall the sale Try to eliminate tough objections early in the 
conversation for an objectionfree close at the end A fun example of this strategy Next 
time youre feeling frisky take two aspirin and a glass of water up to bed Ask your 
spouse to take the two pills Of course she will ask what they are When you tell her 
they are aspirin shell probably say But I dont have a headache Great

The Price Objection 

When was the last time you made a purchase solely based on price You havent and I doubt you ever 
will Your customers dont either Yes I certainly agree that price is very important but its usually six 
or seven down the list of importance Variables within the purchasing decision that may precede price 
include size color delivery warranties availability aftersales service quantities terms and conditions 
and so on 

Price objections are the easiest and most commonthey have become a very natural and predictable 
part of the call Sales entrepreneurs expect them Its as if customers have been trained or conditioned 
to raise the price objection during every sales call Part of the problem is that the retail community 
bombards us with advertisements and promotions focusing on price Weve all heard We wont be 
undersold or Our price is the lowest its the law or If you find it cheaper we will pay you twice the 
difference Every time you pick up the newspaper read flyers see TV commercials listen to the radio 
or stroll through your local mall its PRICE PRICE PRICE No wonder when we arrive at our customers 
offices they scream WHATS YOUR BEST PRICE Simply respond by politely asking your customer 
to refrain from watching TV commercials reading newspapers or listening to the radio ever again It 
seems to be more of a conditioned automatic response than a legitimate concern 

You get what you pay for This clich�� has been around for decades but the message seems to be 
overlooked by some customers There will always be customers who have convinced themselves that a 
low price is their number one priority However my sense is that more and more customers are 
appreciating that price is only one small component of the sale To support my point I share with you a 
comment from economist John Ruskin 

Its unwise to pay too much  but its worse to pay too little When you pay too much you lose a little 
money    that is all When you pay too little you sometimes lose everything because the thing you 
bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do The common law of business balance 
prohibits paying a little and getting a lotit cant be done If you deal with the lowest bidder it is well to 
add something for the risk you run And if you do that you will have enough to pay for something better 

John Ruskin 

 

What impresses me is this was written before  The rationale underlying his theory hasnt changed 
in  years 
Zig Ziglar offers this explanation in support of a competitive price Our company made the decision to 
explain a higher price once rather than justify poor service and quality several times Great line I tell 
my students You only cry once when you pay a higher price 

What is a competitive price Research tells us that customers will pay  to  more for perceived 
value Customers will put their money where their mouth is if you deliver a valueadded solutionbut 
anything over  and the customer may resist For example if your competition is priced at  
you can charge  and still be considered competitively priced    Anything above the 
 may be too aggressive Hence your objective is not to match your competition at the  price 
but rather to price it higher due to the value you created As a consumer Im sure that on more than one 
occasion you paid a higher price because you appreciated the service and attention you received Your 
customers are no different 
The best advice I can offer is that price should not be discussed during the Discovery or Confirming 
steps of your Sequential Model Price is an issue you negotiate Dont sell it What I mean by selling 
it is that salespeople often try to confirm the sale by focusing the conversation on a discounted price 
Sell a valueadded solution during the call not a price solution Dont make price the focal point of the 
call I discuss price in more detail in Chapter  Negotiation Skills 
Understand the difference between price objection and price resistance Price objection is a matter of 
clear opposition to your priceI cant pay it or I wont pay it because we have limited funds and so on 
Price resistance suggests your customers have the capacity to withstand or tolerate your price They 
may not like it initially but they will pay it Salespeople often respond to price resistance by 
immediately offering to lower it Wrong thing to do Try to focus on building value instead of reducing the 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

price Rarely is the sale based solely on price so dont become an ordertaker getting the sale on little 
more than your good looks and a cheap price Customers buy based on their perceptions of the overall 
value you present So how do you create a high perceived value I think William Brooks answers that 
question succinctly in his book Niche Selling He offers the following formula where V is value PB is 
perceived benefits and PP is perceived price  


This formula clearly shows that the higher the PB the higher the value V increases as PB increases 
and PP decreases For example if we have a PP weighting of  and a PB weighting of only  then 
V However if we inverse the numbers where PB and PP our V The first example where 
V tells us that the focus was on price PP Our second example where V the focus was on 
selling benefits thus V was four times greater than in the first example The key to increase the PB is 
to focus on bridging the appropriate features to the benefits as we discussed in Chapter  

Next time your customer says Yes but whats your best price this is what he really means You 
did a good job here today Bernie That was the best feature dump Ive seen this week However you 
have failed to sell me anything of value so I have no option but to create value myself The only way I 
can do that is by hammering you on price If I get you down low enough then maybe Ill see some value 
and buy from you When you fail to create value your customer tries to do it by way of a lowlow price 
Not a good way to sell As one sales manager said The day we are the cheapest price is the day we 
sell this stuff by direct mail Lets stop this ordertaking stuff and focus on selling true value to our 
customers 

Consider this When you pitch features telling versus selling the customer sets the price When you 
present benefits a valueadded solution you set the price Its your choice

Bring It Forward 

Another common situation involves the stall objection or the timing objection A customer may say 
Sounds good but we cant look at it until the next quarter or our next fiscal year Call me in six 
months The timing may not be good or they need to stall until a new budget becomes available My 
strategy in these situations is to bring it forwardbring the situation forward as if the customer were 
making a decision today Simply invite the customer to enter into the hypothetical arena and ask 
Hypothetically if you were to consider making a decision today what would you be looking for Whats 
important to you Maximize this opportunity with the customer do a minidiscovery to learn some 
initial criteria for when it comes time to make a decision You then provide a minipresentation giving 
your customer some insight into what your solution can offer If your customer is receptive and sees 
value ask him or her a hypothetical close If you were to make a decision today would you buy from 
me Remember reiterate to the customer that this is all hypothetical so by no means are they making 
a commitment By going through this bring it forward strategy you and your customer know there is 
valid reason to take a serious look at you come decision time 
This strategy far outweighs the alternative which is to say to your customer Okay fine I understand 
you wont be looking at this for six months Ill call you then Dont leave yourself vulnerable to the 
competition Secure an initial commitment by using the bring it forward strategy and you may pique the 
customers interest enough that he looks forward to having a serious conversation with you at the 
appropriate time Heck he may even say to your competitors Thanks for calling but were already 
looking at somebody 


Your overall objective is to deliver a creative valueadded solution that leaves no doubt in the customers 
mind that youre the best solution Make a vivid impression with an innovative convincing presentation 
Cookiecutter boring presentations do little to advance the salecustomers buy differences not 
similarities 
Dont overlook the you solution Your competitor may offer similar products or services with competitive 
pricing but they cant duplicate you Next time youre asked the question Why should I buy from you 
look the customer square in the eyes and say Because Im your salesperson Dont depend on a 
product solution or a price solution to differentiate yourself Your greatest asset is yourself

Chapter  Confirming the Sale Closing 

Overview 

People buy from people Better yet people love to buy The buying experience can be very rewarding 
and can satisfy many of the motives to buy ego prestige status greed joy of spending money peace 
of mind and so on The ideal sales process is a mutual journey of honesty trust and respect as you 
and your customer work in harmony through the Sequential Model When the journey is mutual 
confirming the sale is not a matter of if but when 

Traditionally this step is referred to as closing the sale However the word closing has negative 
connotations that conjure up images of unscrupulous sales representatives using manipulative guerrilla 
tactics designed to coerce unsuspecting customers into buying Traditional closing techniques typically 
violate the sales relationship Customers today are tired and irritated by these offensive manipulative 
unethical armtwisting tactics 
Make buying easy for your customer by confirming the sale using a nonmanipulative straightforward 
approach and presenting a practical valueadded solution Confirming is the pinnacle of selling 
achievement It is when the customer awards a gold medal to the salesperson who delivered a winwin 
valueadded performance However confirming does not happen in isolation from the total sales 
process You need to be engineering commitment throughout the entire sales call because anything 
you do or say at any step will either erode or enhance the sale Chronologically the confirmation 
comes as Step  of the Sequential Model but be cognizant that your success at this point is based 
on a series of buyins or confirmations throughout the journey Confirmation simply means to create a 
shared sense of enthusiasm to do business then exercise the power of asking The ideal situation is a 
sales entrepreneur who can confidently ask for the business and at the same time be diligent in building 
a relationship by asking smart questions Dont underestimate the power of asking 

Man who wait for roast duck to fly into mouth wait very very long time 

Chinese Proverb 
Why is it that so many salespeople become paralyzed with fear at the thought of closing Even when 
they have successfully navigated through the previous six steps they still fail to ask for a buying 
decision The reasons are as diverse as customers themselves The most common one is fear Fear of 
rejection fear of sounding silly fear of failure fear of upsetting the customer the feeling of not being 
good enough or worthy enough to ask All valid reasons but unfortunately this becomes a negative habit 
pattern that seriously compromises our success at confirming In the interest of harmony and not 
offending a potential customer we unknowingly sacrifice our own agendas by failing to ask 
Psychologists agree that the fear of asking is learned through negative conditioning experienced as 
early as childhood Our parents teachers siblings and even friends have all contributed to nurturing 
this debilitating virus No one is born with it Your fears are all learned and reinforced through repetition 
by those around you even yourself As one lady said when finally asked out by a fellow she admired 
The trouble with you men is that you often reject yourselves before you give us women a chance to 
She was elated when he finally asked her out and without hesitation accepted his invitation The same 
analogy applies to salespeople We often reject or doubt our own proposals or presentations long before 
we give the customer a chance to However because it is a learned condition it can be unlearned as 
well and sometimes very quickly I suggest there is a direct relationship between low corporate 
selfesteem and negative selftalk and your confidence to ask for business Confirming demands an 
attitude of confidence expecting the customer to say yes Anything less puts you in entrepreneurial 
quicksand Just as the Chinese proverb suggests dont expect rewards such as roast duck or a 
confirmed sale unless you ASK

Five Magic Words 

Okay then how do I confirm the sale The Sequential Model offers a refreshingly simple approach to 
confirming In fact the apparent simplicity of it usually invites suspicion Thats it its that simple Let 
me give you the five most powerful words youll ever say when working through your Sequential Model 
Look your customer square in the eyes and with all the confidence you can muster say these five 
magic words  

May I have your business 

and dont say another thing until the customer has responded 

Thats it Five words So simple that I dedicated an entire page to them These words reflect clarity 
sincerity innocence and professionalism Go ahead put the book down and say them aloud Say them 
again These five words are applicable to all four behavioral styles Any one of the four styles will 
appreciate the intent and clarity of your question 

As you can clearly see your Sequential Model need not rely on clever closing gimmicks to trick people 
into buying something they dont want The beauty of this approach is that you know what you are 
saying and the customer knows what you are asking Forget about memorizing  different power 
closeskeep it simple 
What often sabotages this clean refreshing approach is the confusion generated by the numerous 
books available on closing skills Many of them by title alone suggest the need to build an inventory of 
closing techniques Some books even suggest The more closes you know the better youre prepared 
to face the moment of truth Nonsense Consider this passage taken from Dartnells publication Close 
It Right Right Now 

Contrary to the popular belief that closing is an endgame or a final manipulation that sparks 
agreement closing is a constant and continuing activity I warm to the salesperson who shows interest 
in me That helps me decide in his or her favor I am attracted by a sales presentation that gives me 
clear information That helps me favor that product I appreciate learning about how the product fits my 
needs and benefits me That helps me exclude other products I may have considered 

In the absence of all those good things I am not likely to buy no matter how clever the salesperson is 
in trying to button up the sale In fact I am driven from closing when I perceive too much cleverness in 
the procedure  

I have seen numerous books outlining countless closing techniques all advocating the need to have a 
ready supply of closes to apply when needed and all suggesting that an inventory of closes is directly 
related to your success One such publication goes so far as to offer TwentyNine Special Closings 
That Rock Holdouts and Crack Hardcases  Another publication The Sales Closing Book offers 
more than  powerful sales closes that can skyrocket your sales and income The ultimate prize for 
trickery goes to a publication that offers this gem  Tactics for Psychological Manipulation The 
Master Closers Mind Game List  Some typical closes include 

The Whispering Close The Blitz The Airplane Close 
The HalfNelson Lost Sale Close Extra Incentive Close 
EgoProfit Close POW Story Conditional Close 
Puppy Dog Demo The Silent Close Callback Close 
The Columbo Close Return Serve Close The Negative Close 
Door Knob Close The Grind Emotional Close 
Mutt and Jeff Last Resort Close Assumption Close 

Imagine the mental gymnastics required to sort through all those memorized closes to decide which 
one to use Unbelievable I think the only thing that will skyrocket will be your level of stress and anxiety 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

Once again the entrepreneurial sales call should be a dialogue a conversation between two human 
beings Forget about memorized closings putting cute names on closing techniques or rehearsed 
scripts These memorized closes are often manipulative guerrilla approaches that compensate for not 
being good 

Customers like to be asked and they respect the salesperson who asks for their business in an honest 
confident nonmanipulative manner However research suggests that in approximately  of sales 
calls there is never a direct request for the business It may seem like an unbelievable statistic given 
that confirming is the final effort of a goldmedal performance second place is the first loser but its 
true Many salespeople attempt to confirm the sale but end up skirting the issue with a weak 
unconvincing request to do business A common attempt at confirming sounds like this 

S Is there anything else I can show you or answer for you today 
C No thank you Youve answered all my questions and I have all the information I need 
S Okay then Well let me leave you with our most recent brochure and a copy of my presentation Mr 
Smith let me ask you are you available next week 
C Yes I expect to be around 
S Great Why dont I give you a call early next week and we can discuss my proposal further and see 
how you feel about it Is that okay 
C Sure thats fine 
S Great Thanks for your time 
A classic unsuccessful close The salesperson has avoided asking a direct question to buy and is 
leaving with nothing more than hope and a sense of accomplishment Of course in the meantime the 
salesperson is totally vulnerable to the prey of the competition As coincidence would have it the 
competition shows up the very next day offering the customer the same solution but the difference is 
that she exercised the power of asking She wins the gold the salesperson wins nothing more than 
experience I implore you to safeguard yourself against the competition and reevaluate your confirming 
tactics No customer at least that Im aware of will ever reward you for just showing up and making a 
good sales pitch Ask yourself Is my confirmation a direct invitation to purchase Is it clean honest 
direct and nonmanipulative Test it out on fellow sales entrepreneurs your sales manager or your 
mentor 

Tim Commandment  


Confirm the sale with a direct simple question 
Ask Did I ask for their business 


Now before you unceremoniously discount my confirming theory appreciate that Im only suggesting 
this approach the five words in the interest of simplicity honesty and the power of asking I recognize 
that there are other tactics to confirming In fact I endorse more than one approach For example 
simply ask your customer Since we both appear to be in agreement whats our next step or 
alternatively ask Where do we go from here You can preface this confirmation question with a 
summary statement outlining the accepted benefits

Is It No or Is It Know 

Time for a spelling lesson Its important to understand the difference between no and know Sales 
representatives spell no as no taking the meaning literally as more rejection another opportunity lost 
But of course you cant lose something you never had Conversely sales entrepreneurs spell no as 
know the customer simply needs to know more information before making a positive buying decision 
Its not interpreted as rejection but more as an invitation to explain the possible benefits of doing 
business By saying know the customer has not yet seen the value in your offering and needs to know 
more about your tailored solution This means going back to feature fishing and scrolling your corporate 
menu for appropriate features hotbuttons then bridging to create a benefit package worthy of 
consideration Thats value Upon hearing a know you might consider asking the customer What is 
the single barrier preventing us from moving forward A candid response may spotlight a potential 
objection that when managed effectively produces a yes Until the customer sees value youll continue 
to hear knows 
Remember earlier in the book I defined selling as the process of disruption Making a change in 
suppliers or adding a new supplier to the list is scary at the best of times Customers experience fear 
and anxiety just as we do Your benefit package has to be convincing enough to disrupt customers into 
change Customers will continue to say know if there is a bigger yes offered by the competition 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Three Ingredients of a Yes 

Just as a good fire needs three ingredients to burn so does a successful confirmation Take away any 
one of the three ingredients and you have no fire no sale The three ingredients of a Yes are rapport 
trust and the power of asking Just as with the five rights of passage in our definition of selling you 
cant take away or fail to establish any one of the three Unfortunately many salespeople create rapport 
and trust comfortably but fail to ask a direct honest confirming question Sometimes they do ask but 
have failed to first create rapport or trust Would a customer give you a bag of money if he trusted you 
but you failed to ask Not likely Would he say yes if he didnt like you or trust you Not likely Its all 
part of engineering commitment You start confirming the sale the second you come in contact by 
telephone or otherwise with your potential customer 
I find it amusing to hear the different excuses as to why a customer didnt buy Sales representatives 
are the best firedancers on the planet Each probably has  excuses all conveniently memorized 
and of course none blame themselves During my years as a sales manager I could have written a 
book on The reasons why I didnt get the sale No doubt it would have challenged David Chiltons 
book The Wealthy Barber as an international alltime best seller I offer only one reason why a 
salesperson didnt get the sale and ended up in second place My reason doesnt make me popular but 
its inarguable You didnt get the business because you were outsold Pure and simple Strip away all 
the excuses and thats whats left The customer had a need and a bag of money and decided to give it 
to your competitor Why Your competitor probably offered a better valueadded solution having asked 
better smarter questions 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


When to Confirm 

When does one confirm the sale When have you earned the right to ask this most feared and sacred 
question The answer remains elusive subject to broad interpretation often founded on your 
interpretation of perceived buying signals The majority of sales literature suggests confirming When 
the prospect is ready and communicates a buying signal or When the buyer appears ready I have 
always marvelled at the ambiguity in terms of when to confirm Several authors suggest that you rely on 
little more than your own perception of body language and discrete buying signals to interpret when 
theyre ready to buy Unless body language or buying signals are very obvious you run the risk of 
misinterpreting the customers nonverbal communication I agree that body language is a powerful 
component of the communication model but not as the sole method of interpreting when to close 
Everyone is different just as behavioral flexibility suggests each individual has a unique bodylanguage 
style Chapter  Socializers adapt their body language differently from Directors but they could be 
thinking the same thing I dont think that we can apply a universal set of standards to effectively and 
accurately interpret body language 

When discussing body language at my seminars I often notice a participant leaning back in his or her 
chair with arms folded I ask the participant not to move and point out their posture to the class The 
class usually agrees that the school of body language would have us interpret that posture as detached 
uninterested and guarded I then validate my theory by asking the participant with folded arms Are 
you comfortable The answer not surprisingly is usually Yes My suggestion is not to concern 
yourself with body language unless its obvious or unless there is a drastic change during the sales call 
Let your customer be comfortable without interpreting posture as a negative buying signal The only real 
body language that I respond to is if my customer gets up and leaves the office Then I clue in that 
perhaps the call isnt going as well as Id hoped 
So when do you confirm the sale Confirm the sale when you have successfully bridged a minimum of 
two features to benefits You have now earned the right to ask One bridged benefit is usually not 
enough to convince them to buy which is why I suggest a minimum of two If the customer says yes 
thats great Go to Step  If they say know then go back to feature fishing and continue to bridge As 
we can appreciate each customer is different Some only require two benefits to confirm others may 
require several Once again customers may simply need to know more before they say yes 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Nine Tips for Confirming the Sale 

 
Ask a confirming question only after you have effectively bridged a minimum of two 
appropriate features to benefits 
 
Help people make buying decisions by pointing out how your valueadded solution will 
benefit their business 
 
Highlight how the benefits outweigh the costs create value 
 
Successful confirmation isnt an isolated tactic its creating value throughout the 
Sequential Model 
 
If you cant confirm you didnt successfully complete a prior stepplanning discovery 
or presenting a creative valueadded solution 
 
Before asking for a decision expect customers to say yesmentally picture them 
saying it 
 
When you ask people for a buying decision be quiet until they respond 
 
A confirming question asks for a decision A trial close such as What do you think of 
my presentation so far calls for an opinion 
 
If you cant make a sale make a friend

Doubling Your Close Ratio 

Recall that approximately  of purchases occur after the order has been requested five times and yet 
only  of salespeople ask five times before quitting Likewise  of salespeople ask only once 
then quit These  quit for a variety of reasons impatience the craving for instant gratification poor 
followup no timemanagement system or just simple laziness There is no doubt that these statistics 
are shocking but customers are the victims of these lackluster performances on a daily basis 
Imagine having to confirm five times before you get a yes That means on average there are four knows 
before a yes Thats a lot of work Some authors suggest selling is a numbers game talk to ten people 
get five presentations close two deals That sounds like a lot of worknot selling very smart It bears 
out the fact that the average close ratio is only  That means on average salespeople close only 
two out of ten potential opportunities Funny I always thought selling was about people not a game 
with winners losers and average mediocre performances Dont fall victim to the numbers game 
condemning your career to a life of mediocrity Dont measure your success against the masses By 
comparing yourself against the averages you only fuel a false sense of productivity I say set your own 
standards Dont take pride in being averageits too easy and not very satisfying 

Remember that confirming is not an event but a process that begins within minutes of meeting the 
customer Customers are very quick to pass judgment wasting no time deciding if you are likable and 
trustworthy The first step to doubling your close ratio is to ensure the first six steps of your sequential 
model have been completed to the customers satisfaction 


Hence if close ratios are a meager  that means the customers ratio is  Ouch Customers are 
closing more often than we are They sell us on the concept of not doing business with them They offer 
a multitude of excuses objections and justifications all in the interest of selling us their no The 
problem is we are too quick to accept their rejection and with a bruised ego return to the adult daycare 
center to lick our wounds and seek support Sound familiar 

So what is a good close ratio I would suggest that as a sales entrepreneur your target should be no 
less than  That means if you approach ten potential customers ones with a need and a bag of 
money you should confirm at least four to five Sound daunting It isnt Some topnotch sales 
entrepreneurs are confirming up to  of potential customers 

Start by evaluating your current ratio Track it for a month or two and reality will quickly reveal itself It 
may not be as high as you think it is If yours is higher than  congratulations you are in the 
minority But I will remind you your objective is  Proper execution of your Sequential Model will 
certainly contribute to doubling your current close ratio It simply means building rapport and trust as 
you navigate through the first six steps of your model coupled with the confidence to ask for their 
business Customers expect to be asked dont disappoint them They get irritated by reps who fail to 
complete the sales call with no direct close You represent a solution to their needs so the only 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

outstanding issue is to ask them If you dont someone else willand be rewarded with a bag of money 
Hence taking your close ratio to  is not an impossible arduous objective 

However I caution you dont strive to achieve a  confirmation ratio Not only will it never happen 
you dont want  You couldnt handle it Youre already timestarved with what you have Free up 
time by firing C accounts and C activities and increase productivity by doubling your confirmation ratio 
on A and B opportunities If a  confirmation ratio is your goal then work at McDonalds or Burger 
King Everyone who walks in buys something When was the last time you heard this conversation in 
McDonalds 

May I help you 

Oh no thanks just looking 

My point is this Achieving a confirmation ratio of  is hard work and yet it can be very rewarding 
Success is hard work A job that has a  confirmation ratio generally pays minimum wage

Be  

When it comes time to confirm you will certainly encounter customers who say no and mean no Dont 
despair An excellent alternative plan is to have your customers place a small order with you Tell them 
you are not expecting them to make a wholesale change in suppliers but ask them to place a small 
order to test you out The proof is in the pudding Its okay to be  just ask the people at AVIS 
RentaCar If you are successful at getting and delivering a few small orders it wont be long before you 
build up to getting the lions share of their business Chances are your unsuspecting competitor wont 
know what happened until its too late I have personally converted several accounts from a no to a know 
to a yes by using this strategy Customers can be creatures of habit and usually go with whats been 
tested and proven Your  strategy provides an opportunity to showcase your stuff while building 
confidence and trust in you Remember the fifth pillar of success is Patient yet Persistent Chapter  
Quiet persistence coupled with patience ultimately pay off handsomely with the reward of becoming 
their  supplier 
Always act like a professional Dont take the customers rejection personally Recognize it as a 
business decision based on circumstances you may be unaware of Be grateful for the opportunity to 
meet and discuss the possibility of doing business The professional handling of a no sale situation 
actually helps build a sound relationship by developing a spirit of professionalism and persistence The 
customer will be much more receptive to a  strategy if you handle the no sale situation professionally 
Remember if you cant make a sale make a friend 
One of the greatest pleasures of selling is the adrenaline rush and elation when the customer says 
Yes lets do business This is the moment of yes There have been many private dances in 
customers parking lots clenched fists pumping through the air accompanied by triumphant shouts of 
Yesss and smiles that make dentists proud Confirming the sale is the pinnacle of achievementall 
your efforts have paid a handsome return Unquestionably the greatest thrill for a sales entrepreneur is 
the moment of yes when the customer agrees to buy from you in the interest of a honest mutually 
beneficial solution 
Become comfortable with using the five magic words and make them part of your professional equity 
Confirming with these five words communicates confidence and offers a refreshing change for the 
customer Another tremendous advantage is that this approach is universalthe same five words can 
be used regardless of what you are selling Bigticket items long sales cycles short sales cycles a 
product or service it doesnt matterthe five words must be applied to every possible sales scenario 
Sales entrepreneurs understand that the power of asking is what ultimately separates a professional 
salesperson from a professional conversationalist

Chapter  Creative Negotiation There is Always a 
Way 

Overview 

Children are accomplished negotiators If they need extra allowance a later bedtime a sleepover they 
usually get it Children can be relentless in their pursuit of what they want Familiarity gives them the 
advantage of knowing what parental hotbuttons to push They are the best examples of ideal 
negotiators Then they grow up and abandon the natural negotiating talents they learned instinctively 

Like selling negotiation is something we use in every facet of our lives I am often entertained just 
watching my three teenagers negotiate the use of one car Amazingly it usually works out I think most 
of us are better negotiators than we give ourselves credit for Negotiation is one of those transparent 
interpersonal skills we use unconsciously Negotiation is really a relationship skill used by people to 
deal with their conflicts and differences Throughout this chapter my goal is to leverage existing 
negotiation skills to build confidence and an awareness of longforgotten negotiation principles and 
tactics 

Unfortunately the very thought of negotiation conveys negative connotations striking fear in the souls of 
most salespeople Often the outcome of negotiation leaves people feeling dissatisfied worn out or 
alienated A winlose mindset has prevailed for decades The negotiator customer or salesperson 
attempts to win important concessions and thus triumph over the opponent It resembles the outcome 
of most sports winnerloser Not all successful salespeople are good negotiators Most salespeople are 
not adequately trained in the art of negotiation and dont understand its many nuances The necessary 
traits for successful negotiation vary somewhat but some characteristics are universal including 
patience persistence stamina and confidence Each negotiation is situational with both sides 
discussing the points over which disagreement exists In reality no single negotiation session covers 
exactly the same issues or demands

When Do We Negotiate 

Almost anything can be negotiated with the application of sound principles The biggest 
misunderstanding is not so much how to negotiate but when Salespeople eager to do the deal often 
initiate premature negotiation trying to negotiate before the time is right 
So when is the best time to negotiate In the majority of sales situations salespeople attempt to enter 
into negotiation before the customer has agreed to do business There is a better more productive 
approach 
Sales professionals engage in negotiation when a customer has expressed an interest to do business 
We negotiate after the confirmation step after the customer has agreed to do business with you 


Upon initial reflection this concept may seem bizarre and contrary to traditional sales techniques but 
thats only because youve done it that way for years Although it may have worked for you in the past 
its not a very smooth or fluid approach 
Confirmation has two aspects initial confirmation where the customer is in agreement and willingly 
moves into the negotiation phase and final confirmation where the customer has accepted all the 
terms and conditions of your solution including price Initial confirmation may sound like this If we can 
work out a competitive price may I have your business If the customer is in agreement you now have 
earned the right to negotiate Its much easier to negotiate terms conditions and price once you have a 
willing party Your next step is final confirmation Now that we have agreed on a competitive price may I 
have your business It doesnt need to get any more complicated than that 


In our twoday sales negotiation seminar salespeople are often shocked to learn that price should not 
be part of the sale Its a separate discussion that takes place as part of negotiating final confirmation 
Its no different than buying a house You decide on location size number of bedrooms and other 
features After you pick a home you make an offer which means you are now negotiating The offer 
goes back and forth as both parties negotiate all the details including price In most cases the 
negotiating goes smoothly because there are two willing parties a seller and a buyer Use the same 


advantage in sales by using your Sequential Model to create a willing buyer 
Tim Commandment  
Negotiate after initial confirmation 
Ask Have I earned the right to negotiate 
Now its in each partys best interests to negotiate a winwinwinwin solution The four winners are your 
customer and his or her company and you and your company With two willing parties there is always 
a way in spite of initial barriers and disagreements Details can be worked out when both parties are 
motivated to do so If not details can easily undermine a possible solution Its not a good deal if one of 
the four wins is missing or compromised The idea is to reach mutually beneficial agreements that 
resolve inconveniences or dissatisfaction and solidify longterm relationships 

Trust plays a major role in successful negotiation Although there is no guarantee that trust will lead to 
collaboration mistrust will inhibit collaboration When people trust one another they are more likely to 
communicate openly and honestly In contrast if people do not trust you they are more likely to 
withdraw and be less cooperative Acting in a trusting manner throughout the relationship serves as an 
invitation to others to be trustworthy especially if your trusting manner is consistent Each negotiator 
must believe that both parties choose to behave in a cooperative manner Trust is not a onetime 
singular event It is established over time by demonstrating professionalism honesty integrity 
consistency and cooperation and by following through on promises and commitments Cooperative 
behavior is a signal of honesty openness and a shared commitment to a joint solution Take advantage 
of the trust engineered throughout the first seven steps of the model Remember people judge us by our 
actions not by our intentions 
Approaches to negotiation tend to reflect personal experiences biases and perceptions of the 
individuals involved They are often reflected in one of two ways flight or fight People who take the flight 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

approach are uncomfortable with conflict and try to avoid possible rejection frustration and anger 
associated with negotiation They become masters at avoidance and readily prefer to take flight rather 
than experience any degree of conflict Relaters tend to take the flight approach 

The fight approach is supported by a mindset of Only the strong survive and Do unto others before 
they do unto you Directors tend to favor this approach Its a classic winlose scenario Bargaining and 
compromise are two components of fight Bargaining is where you have a predetermined position and 
you haggle back and forth working hard grinding your opponent down You pursue this approach until 
you are victorious Compromise occurs when both sides give in and split the difference settling for half 
a loaf Compromise may satisfy both parties but only to a limited extent Of course half a loaf in a 
highly competitive arena may be viewed as better than none but if it becomes normal practice the 
results may be less than desirable for both sides 
A more effective approach one that fosters longterm relationships is creative negotiation Creative 
negotiation is defined as Both parties seek to resolve their differences by working synergistically to 
create a higher quality valueadded solution Both parties acknowledge the need to reach agreement 
working amicably and creatively toward a solution that satisfies each

Five Principles of Creative Negotiation 

Dealing with conflict and differences is rarely an easy task Barriers to creative negotiation can be 
numerous and are often the saboteurs of a potential sale Remember your goal is to reach 
winwinwinwin settlements with qualified customers To that end I offer these five principles of creative 
sales negotiation 

Principle  Attitude First 

Are you a good negotiator Your answer reflects your level of confidence in your negotiation skills 
Creating a positive mindset involves basic attitudinal characteristics which become the building blocks 
for successful negotiation As discussed in Chapter  attitudes and skills must work in harmony 
Attitudinal characteristics of negotiation include selfawareness selfbelief and an openness to other 
viewpoints Salespeople frequently overlook the importance of preparing themselves mentally Attitude 
how we deal with others when negotiatingdrives the relationship Develop a winwinwinwin attitude 
toward negotiation and dont be satisfied until all parties are pleased with the solution 

Principle  Planning and Preparation 

You may be thinking D��j�� vudidnt we already discuss this Yes we did in Chapter  We need to 
talk about it again For many of us planning is boring and tedious easily put off in favor of leaping into 
action quickly However devoting insufficient time to planning frequently results in failure to negotiate a 
mutually beneficial agreement and raises feelings of hostility and frustration 

The cornerstone to effective creative negotiation is a carefully designed blueprint outlining specifically 
desired results for both you and your customer The first step is to clearly articulate your positionknow 
what your objectives are Know the issues that are not negotiable and the issues that are negotiable I 
refer to them as your musthave and nicetohave issues Musthave issues are predetermined prior 
to negotiation and are essential to a satisfactory agreement They are simply not negotiable Your 
nicetohave issues are negotiable Although they would be nice to have they are not essential to the 
agreement They are issues you are prepared to concede or use as tradeoffs in the interest of 
concluding the agreement or maintaining the relationship 

Your window of flexibility is guided by your predetermined minmax pointsmin being your lowest 
acceptable point and max being your best most ideal position So in the interests of creative 
negotiation each of your musthave issues should be accompanied by a window of flexibilityyour 
minmax points Lets look at the example below 


As a sales entrepreneur your musthave issue is making a profit To do this you are guided by the 
flexibility of your predetermined minmax points As in Figure  the ideal situation is a maxpoint of 
 whereas your minpoint is  Any price lower than your minpoint is unacceptableyou may 
have to entertain other avenues such as concessions or tradeoffs to secure the deal The wider the 
spread between your minmax points the more flexibility you have to negotiate Otherwise you may 
become too rigid and inflexible deadlocking the negotiation In terms of your nicetohave issues I 
suggest there are no minmax points These issues are subject to negotiation and may be used as 
concessions to advance the deal The key to creative negotiation is knowing your parameters prior to 
negotiation Whenever possible plan your strategy beforehand Its tough to negotiate creatively if you 
dont know the parameters of your destination In creative negotiation those who ask for more typically 
get more  and those with low targets typically underachieve 

Also consider whether negotiation is appropriate at all It may be a C account or a C opportunity In 
some sales situations negotiation can take place spontaneously so be aware of the status of the 
opportunity A B or C You may have to respond on the fly so be sure to have the complete account 
file with you at the call for quick reference to previous discussions 

The second step in negotiation planning is to define the issues worthy of negotiation Refer to all your 
notes and assemble all the issues yours and your customers into a comprehensive list Some issues 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

may have been resolved prior to the negotiation which is fine but be sure to identify any outstanding 
issues It can be frustrating and costlyin terms of time and successif the customer calls you just 
prior to inking the deal with an unresolved issue After the issues are assembled the next step is to 
prioritize them By sharing the list with your customer you continue to build trust and confidence as 
you work through it together Extract relevant information from your notes to enhance your position A 
comment in your notes from six months ago may be a valuable piece of information Salespeople often 
compensate for inadequate planning by conceding more than necessary This shortcut can be very 
costly 

Sales entrepreneurs cannot afford to be quick and clever during the give and take of negotiation 
Planning increases your negotiation success substantially and helps you achieve solutions that you 
never thought possible Invest the time and energy during janitorial hours to prepare a strategy in line 
with your customers behavioral style Your strategy will help you relax face fewer unknowns and 
reduce stress 

Principle  Know the Lingo 

The negotiation arena has a language of its own I have seen many negotiation sessions fail simply due 
to not understanding the language of negotiation My objective here is not to provide you with an 
indepth study of all the nuances of negotiation but to create a mindset an awareness and an overview 
of the logistics of creative sales negotiation I suggest you augment your negotiation skills and 
confidence by considering other publications on the subject Consider this chapter as your springboard 
to further study 



ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


Language of Negotiation 

The following terms should become part of every sales entrepreneurs vocabulary 

 
Concessions Giving in to a customers request without asking for anything in return 
Concessions are central to creative negotiation They are the backbone to a mutually 
accepted outcome as they acknowledge the other party and communicate sensitivity to 
his or her issues and demands Initial concessions can be effectivethey communicate 
that you are willing and that your intentions are honorable Many authors suggest that 
negotiation involves a progression of concessions 
Once again your minmax points must be clearly defined prior to giving concessions Know 
your parameters and dont give away the farm Begin the negotiation by offering small 
concessions Concede the items or issues to which you attach little importance The sooner 
you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate the sooner the customer will respond in kind 
Dont give away big concessions too early Use them to respond to a customers concession 
or to secure the deal Can we confirm the deal if I give you XX However you need to draw 
the line when your minpoint is being compromised 
 
TradeOffs Give customers what they want in return for something of comparable 
value Value is perception The item may not be equal in monetary terms but it may be 
equal in perceived value As youve heard before One mans garbage is another mans 
treasure Once again know your musthave issues and your minmax points before 
determining what you are willing to trade 
The power of tradeoffs is enormous and can have a tremendous impact on your productivity 
By asking for a tradeoff you elevate the value of your concession It also stops the grinding 
process Marry your concession to a tradeoff otherwise your customer will continue to 
make demands You might as well say Sure here you go its yours for the asking A 
confident negotiator exercises give concessions and take tradeoffs throughout the 
negotiation process moving the dialogue toward a winwinwinwin solution However the 
rule of thumb is to stay flexiblethere is always a way 
 
WalkPoint The point where you walk away from the deal because your minimum 
musthave issues are not being met If through tradeoffs and concessions you are 
unable to reach an agreement that satisfies your predetermined parameters your only 
option may be to walk However walking may only be a temporary solution Both 
parties may be receptive to a recess a coolingoff period In the interest of an 
agreement you may both agree to revisit your parameters and get together again 
tomorrow next week or next month Although both parties may privately wish there 
were some way to get back together they usually dont know how to arrange a 
reconciliation Open and honest communication coupled with an attitude of 
winwinwinwin is your key to avoiding an impass 
 
ImpassDeadlock Where communication no longer moves the agreement forward and 
conversation seems to go in circles There is nothing wrong with deadlockeither party 
has the right to prefer no deal to one that falls short of their minpoint How do we break 
an impass Change the negotiators change the parameters call a third party to 
mediate change the shape of money larger deposit different terms cash versus 
credit or consider changing venues These tactics can help create a climate in which 
new alternatives can be developed There is always a way 
 
Agree to Disagree Both parties may agree to disagree rather than reaching an 
agreement that compromises both parties leaving each resentful and disappointed If 
your agreement is undermined you may lack the commitment necessary to carry it out 
Once again this could be a temporary situation Negotiation might be better served two 
or three months down the road This tactic can be effective in personal relationships as 
well It can even work with your spouse 
 
Confessions Not only are confessions good for the soul but they can be a good tactic 
for negotiators Confessing telling all you know revealing your motives and needs 
can be a good way to gain empathy People tend to be more charitable to someone 
who tells all You also demonstrate honesty and a sincere desire to do business 
However no need to share your personal net worth or your most recent sexual fantasy 
Principle  Negotiate Price Dont Sell It 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

Is price the most important aspect of the sale No Never has been never will be Customers have never 
based their buying decisions solely on price and I doubt they ever will However salespeople convince 
themselves that price is the number one motivator to purchase Studies show that salespeople bring up 
price before the customer does  of the time Why Im not sure but I suppose salespeople feel 
obligated to bring it up or perhaps they have been trained to do so It could even be lack of confidence 
or corporate selfesteem 

Many salespeople violate the sales process by introducing price too soon Ideally price should not be 
discussed until after your initial confirmation During the call you need to focus on selling value and 
benefits to the customer Dont mention price unless the customer asks or you are negotiating I realize 
this concept may seem somewhat manipulative and irresponsible but it isnt I have confirmed several 
deals without the customer or me mentioning price I think its part of the rapport and trust issue I spoke 
of earlier If a customer trusts you and feels comfortable with you price is not an important issue There 
is an implied understanding that your price will be competitive otherwise you wouldnt be in business 
By shifting the conversation to price prior to initial confirmation the salesperson has invited the 
customer to openly challenge the price Some salespeople are convinced the customers mandate is to 
hammer the salesperson into submission finally succumbing to a rockbottom price Classic tactic of a 
C account How to negotiate against price and discount pressure is a common challenge among sales 
professionals Youve probably heard it before Your price is too high Youll just have to do better or 
Its a competitive market Your competitors can beat that price or Youll have to show more flexibility 
on your discounting and so it goes When salespeople concede too quickly in these situations they 
not only reduce profitability but also devalue their customers perceptions of the product or service 
Dont respond by asking Whats the price theyre offering you or What price do I have to beat This 
is a common mistake because it shifts the focus to pure price and discount levels Experienced 
negotiators shift the focus to value comparisons versus price comparisons 

When dealing with the price issue be guided by knowing your minmax points If you have price or 
discount flexibility do not give it all away at once Instead concede slowly and reluctantly Also 
consider trading price concessions for major commitments It could sound like this If I give you X 
price will you give me net day terms or COD terms If the customer is insistent on a discounted 
price dont hesitate to ask for something from them that makes the deal a winwinwinwin 
Acknowledge the customers curiosity about price but dont get sucked into a price debate prior to 
initial confirmation For example when you ask for their business using the five magic words in Chapter 
 your customers may inquire about your price Simply say Yes Im sure we both recognize that 
price is important but at this point can we agree to do business together based on the benefits 
discussed as long as I can give you a competitive price If the customer says yes to your initial 
confirmation you now have a willing party with whom to negotiate Consider the initial confirmation as a 
conditional sale conditional upon working out terms and conditions supported by a competitive price 
What salespeople need to realize is that if a fair price cannot be worked out then there is no deal Final 
confirmation is conditional upon successful negotiation However dont negotiate all aspects of the deal 
and then focus separately on price Make sure price or discount is part of the whole package not a 
separate negotiation 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 


During negotiation be cognizant of your customers behavioral style and adapt If you are selling to a 
Director and she wants to know the price prior to initial confirmation I would be inclined to acknowledge 
the request and offer a price range Dont be exact with your answer 

Principle  Negotiate the Issues not the Personalities 

Often what causes you to become frustrated or angry in a negotiation is not the topic or issue but your 
customers personality traits By putting emotional distance between yourself and the negotiation you 
gain a tremendous advantage Negotiations often unleash emotions that shortcircuit rational processes 
We sometimes abandon our carefully designed strategy and resort to a flight or fight response The key 
to effective winwin negotiation is to react unemotionally 
From time to time you may find yourself dealing with an individual you do not particularly care for 
Chances are you wouldnt invite him to go camping with you but he may represent an A account and a 
sizeable business opportunity Experienced negotiators understand that professionalism requires the 
ability to distance oneself from any emotional distractions These may include biases perceptions 
values fear of being exploited egos feelings moods stress and so on Parties can get too caught up 
in the emotions of negotiation They become too close to the deal and overlook important facts that may 
help move the deal forward In spite of all your efforts to build a personal relationship you may find 
yourself dealing with just a corporate relationship You can both still benefit by simply doing business 
together and nothing else Dont entangle relationship challenges within the negotiating process 
For most salespeople the major barrier is simply the fear of negotiation The very thought sends 
paralyzing shivers up their spines The toughest hurdle is learning to be confident enough to stand up to 
the challenge This means developing the ability to comfortably express a position without hurting 
anyone or being hurt Many people find the straightforward aggressive business dialogue of negotiation 
intimidating Its the same challenge with confirming the fear of rejection or perhaps sounding too 
aggressive Our natural human tendencies prevailin our adolescent years we were taught that it was 
polite not to ask for things and never to be confrontational 
The best approach to dealing with the emotional aspect of negotiation is the pause button Pushing the 
pause button means putting the negotiation on hold while you take a break to reevaluate the situation 
This may be for a few minutes or an hour or after you have slept on it Michael and Mini Donaldson offer 
this explanation in their book Negotiation for Dummies 

Knowing when and how to push the pause button not only endows you with an aura of composure and 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

confidence but also gives you control over all the critical points of the negotiation 

They go on to say 

No single skill can be as helpful to you as the pause button in any situation laden with heavy emotional 
overtones Almost by definition you cannot fully prepare ahead of time for these situations Your 
judicious use of the pause button can compensate Pushing the pause button produces better results 
or at least results that you feel better about 

The message is clear dont be afraid to utilize your pause button Use it to reevaluate your position 
Perhaps in the interest of flexibility it can become an opportunity to reconsider your musthave issues 
and your minmax points Remember with two willing parties there is always a way

Low of  Options 

A few years ago I had the pleasure of hearing Jim Rohn an international motivational speaker speak at 
a sales conference in Calgary One of his many suggestions was to be guided in life and in sales by 
the Law of Ten Options His point is this with a cancellation or postponement of an event there are 
always ten other optionsten alternatives to consider For example if you and your spouse had 
planned an evening out with the Jones but at the last minute they gracefully declined due to sickness 
you now have ten options to considergo see a movie see a play visit other friends clean the garage 
read a book and so on All is not lost because of a sudden change in plans The first five or six options 
may present themselves quite readily whereas the final three or four may require some creative thinking 
perhaps even some alternatives outside your comfort zone It works well My wife and I often discuss 
our ten options and frequently come up with options that are as enjoyable or more enjoyable than the 
original cancelled event 

Rohns law can be applied to all situations and it can be particularly useful in pursuing the spirit of 
creative negotiation Have some fun with it Anyone with teenagers will immediately understand how 
effective it can beteenagers exercise the Law of Ten Options on a daily basis 

Negotiation is not a game with a single objective but rather one step in building effective longterm 
relationships It is only one of the ten steps in your Sequential Model but it can be the pivotal point in 
your relationship and your success During negotiation you forge an agreementlike taking the 
relationship from a courtship to a marriage Will you marry me may not be your actual request but 
your final confirmation the five magic words certainly suggests the commitment and responsibilities of 
a marriage 

One of the surest ways to successful negotiation is to be well prepared Its essential but planning is 
often overlooked in the excitement of approaching the finish line Its like training and conditioning to run 
a marathon but then running out of steam at the mile mark So many salespeople come close to the 
finish line but fail to complete the race because of a lack of training and preparation We cannot afford to 
ignore the dire consequences of inadequate preparation Planning is not an isolated step of your 
Sequential Model but is a prerequisite to successful graduation of each and every stepincluding 
creative negotiation 

The skills outlined in this chapter will help you to build confidence and reach your business and 
personal objectives Understand not only how to negotiate but when Review the five principles regularly 
and continue to fuel your confidence to not only run a good marathon but to finish it

Chapter  Action Plan Implementation 

Congratulations on your successful negotiation The customer said yes you reached a winwinwinwin 
agreement and now its time to take action This is what you have been working so hard to achieve the 
opportunity to showcase your company and your product and to deliver on all the benefits and 
promises you presented earlier However in many ways your job is just beginning Just as in a 
marriage the I do should be I will doYour customers have high expectationsdont let them down 
In fact the more they spend the higher their expectations People expect their purchases to be perfect 
and hasslefree 

Surprisingly the details of an effective action plan are often overlooked in the euphoria of finally 
anchoring the deal Nevertheless your role now is to quarterback all the activities necessary for a 
smooth seamless implementation rather than race to the car dig out a calculator and excitedly work 
out your commission andor bonus Its important that you identify and delegate responsibilities to 
ensure a timely hasslefree delivery of your solution A big part of what your customer just purchased is 
peace of mind about a worryfree delivery Customers need to feel they have made a wise intelligent 
investment Initially they may feel a little uneasy insecure about their decision After all you have 
convinced them to embrace change 

My People Need to Talk to Your People 

All parties must understand their roles and responsibilities and work in harmony for a smooth 
implementation Its a good idea for both you and your customer to identify all parties involved in the 
implementation This is what Ill do within this time frame and these are the people to involve Parties 
involved may include management operations accounting manufacturing engineering 
shippingreceiving inventory control technical people delivery people and so on You cant do it alone 
so draw on the strengths of your internal customers and your customers people to ensure a smooth 
speedy hasslefree implementation With all parties working in harmony the story of these four people 

becomes a reality  
WHAT WENT RIGHT 
This is the story of four people Everybody Anybody Somebody and Nobody There was an 
important job to be done and Nobody was sure that Anybody would do it but instead Somebody did 
it Nobody got angry because it was Anybodys job There was no need for Nobody to blame 
AnybodySomebody did the job Anybody could have done Nobody made excuses but 
Everybody was satisfied 

Communication at the best of times is fraught with uncertainty biases and individual perceptions 
Effective communication is a topic onto its own Poor communication often results in costly oversights 
and mistakes Communication is a very delicate fragile process As responsible sales entrepreneurs 
we need to ensure an effective exchange of information 

For larger more sophisticated deals I suggest both parties safeguard themselves against the normal 
pitfalls of communication and consider drafting a letter of intent or a letter of agreement I dont mean a 
legal document that requires hiring a lawyer at  for every three minutes I simply mean putting a 
letter together on your company letterhead outlining the logistics of the deal Who is doing what and by 
when You and your customer can review it for accuracy and completeness signing your respective 
copies 
Part of your responsibilities also include avoiding or at least minimizing user error To do so you must 
evaluate your customers abilities technical or otherwise and recommend training if necessary 
Research suggests that up to  of the time customers are wrong Reported product and service 
problems resulted from customer error product misuse or failure to read the instructions Customers 
do screw up but as professionals we have to allow them to maintain dignity It takes a strong attitude to 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

let certain things go while biting your tongue You must also make your customer aware of the breakin 
period the time required to fully appreciate the benefits of your product or service This may not be 
apparent initially True happiness will only come once everyone is using your product correctly

Customers Dont Shoot the Messenger 

We no longer live in times where they behead the messenger although Im sure that on occasions 
customers are tempted In the eyes of customers the salesperson is ultimately responsible for seeing 
that the product or service is delivered when promised If problems arise when filling an order and this is 
not unusual customers should be informed promptly The progress of the order or any possible back 
orders should also be monitored and communicated to the customer so that if something goes wrong 
alternative arrangements can be made Customers may not jump for joy at the news but they will 
certainly appreciate the opportunity to take corrective action 
Customers can become disgruntled for a number of reasons most of which turn out to be minor when 
handled properly tactfully and in a timely manner Dealing with panicstricken customers demanding 
instant satisfaction can be an emotionally draining exercise These intolerable nuisances if left 
unresolved can easily and quickly escalate into a mountainous catastrophe Unfortunately human 
beings tend to focus on the negativewhat went wrong versus what went right Your phone call will go a 
long way to prevent the proverbial poop from hitting the fan Be the bearer of bad news before your 
customers call you When you call they will be easier to manage but when they call its too latetheyre 
in no mood to listen to your blamefest 
Monitoring order processing and other aftersales activity is critical to developing a partnership A 
Purchasing Magazine study indicated that failure to follow through after the sale was the secondbiggest 
complaint of buyers What was the first one Talking too much 

Many specific activities are essential to ensure customer loyalty and satisfaction Sales entrepreneurs 
must be jugglers Continue to build trust monitor proper usage assist in servicing the account and 
provide expert guidance and assistance Adopting an empathetic attitude to a real or imaginary problem 
cannot be overemphasized

customers have a different way of saying it Customers complain with their feet they walk If a customer

Effective followup after confirmation and successful negotiation means going that little bit extra for your 
customer The little things often move a relationship forward The result is a winwinwinwin The win for 
you is anchoring a solid client a source of referrals and secondselling opportunities within an existing 
account When we treat our customers with respect and appreciation we feel good about ourselves At 
the same time our customers feel good about working with us A longterm business relationship is

Its a fact that customers will forget you within  days Your parents might even forget you every couple 
of months You have worked hard through Steps  to  and now its time to use all your resources 
and tools to protect your newly acquired asset You must build a fortress of loyalty to keep the watchful 
eye of your competitors out I have often said that getting the first sale is easy Its getting the repeat 
orders that truly validates your performance as a sales entrepreneur 

Keeping your customer happy and satisfied requires conscious effort It is part of the ongoing process of 
assessment feedback and reassessment that makes you continually responsive to your customer Its 
difficult to coordinate the pursuit of new customers while servicing and growing existing accounts I think 
this anonymous quote says it well A relationship will deteriorate over time A natural tendency of any 
relationship business or marriage is toward erosion of sensitivity and attentiveness It requires a solid 
effort against the forces of decline A powerful statement indeed

Too often we take our good customers As and Bs for granted They are the ones who are easy to deal 
with rarely giving us trouble They even provide positive wordofmouth recommending our product or 
service to associates and friends Because they give us little trouble and are lowmaintenance we often 
forget about them Out of sight out of mind Sales entrepreneurs realize the adage Business goes to 
those who want it and work hard for it and stays with those who work even harder and show 
appreciation for it You must guard against complacency and overconfidence Dont become vulnerable 
to your competition 
Heres something I bet you havent even thought about much less analyzed What is your customer 
attrition rate Surprisingly most businesses experience a  attrition rate but few salespeople 
are aware of the impact customer erosion has on a business Unfortunately experience tells us that the 
customer for life concept is only a myth Customers are only for a measurable period of time The goal 
is to build loyalty to have and to hold as much of the customers attention as realistically possible for 
as long as possible Buyers are selective today and can be frighteningly fickle The fact is that by not 
appreciating or expressing gratitude for their business  of your customers will leave or at least 
reduce the frequency of business they do with you Ironically you probably wrestle with Where do I 
find new business Yet the easiest and most inexpensive method is not to lose them in the first place 

Price is rarely if ever the culprit for high attrition In the majority of situations it is an attitude of 
indifference that drives customers away motivated by a competitor who is more than happy to shower 
them with lots of attention during the courting phase Your customers want to feel that they are 
appreciated and valued by you not merely seen as a dollar transaction Im not suggesting you can ever 
eliminate attrition but you can proactively minimize its debilitating effect on the growth of your business 

Just as little things can turn a customer off little things will turn a customer on 

Protecting your customer base is a top priority Its the difference between selling hard or selling smart 
Research tells us that its five to six times more expensive to replace a customer than to keep one I 
suppose its no different than divorce So how do you show your customers that you think of them often 
and that you love em In a relationship there is only one way to say I love you but there are 


ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version ABC Amber CHM Converter Trial version 

countless ways of showing it Speaking for my gender males are known for not communicating feelings 
or expressing emotions In relationships we dont tell our spouse or significant other I love you often 
enough The response is more like this Honey you know I love you and if that changes youll be the 
second to know Your mate appreciates hearing I love you just as your customers need to hear and 
see your appreciation for their business

Handwritten Personalize it with your own handwriting If your penmanship is sloppy 
write slower 
 
Dont use company letterhead Buy some nice stationary that doesnt scream 
business letter It must be a personal gesture 
 
Handwrite the envelope too Personalize the whole package 
 
Buy stamps Use a stamp Dont put it through a mailing machine A typed envelope 
with a corporate stamp on it takes away from the personal touch It also looks lazy 
 
Include your business card It clearly indicates who this note is from A handwritten 
note simply signed by you may cause confusion or uncertainty as to the sender Your

customer may not know you all that wellyet 

 
Dont expect a response Although it may seem your efforts have gone unnoticed 
your customers do appreciate it In these busy times customers simply dont have time 
to pick up the phone and thank you I once sent a note and heard nothing back but the 
next time I made a call my note was displayed on her credenza

Conclusion 

Congratulations Youve covered a lot of material and have successfully graduated through all ten steps 
of your Sequential Model Welcome to this years graduating class of sales entrepreneurs You are now 
part of an elite group of professionals 

Now the fun begins Application of the strategies and techniques throughout the Sequential Model 
enables you to navigate with confidence through the entire sales call steadily moving your customer 
toward a buying decision Your completed Sequential Model is a continuous loop guiding you through 
every aspect of the relationship with each completed step setting up the next Your biggest challenge 
now will be to unlearn cherished old sales habits and to embrace the new techniques outlined 
throughout the Sequential Model 

Change is a prerequisite to success Learning is a sequential process marked by stages of growth and 
development Learning is cumulative Practice is the key 

A central theme throughout the book focuses on the role and responsibilities of sales entrepreneurs 
Sales organizations are slowly reshaping themselves to foster entrepreneurial approaches to selling 
You are no longer expected to be servicing a territory but managing a business The future will not be 
an option for sales representativesthey need not apply 

I share with you a comment from a very successful sales entrepreneur You beat  of the 
salespeople in North America just by working hard You beat another  by being a person of honesty 
and integrity The last  is a dogfight in the free enterprise system I agree His comment is a 
strong reminder of the importance of embracing an entrepreneurial code of conduct guided by your 
Sequential Model 

Earlier in the book I discussed the importance of a winning edge and the compelling influence that 
attitude has on your personal life and your career The importance of the five attitudinal pillars and how 
they are intrinsically linked to success cannot be underestimated Attitude drives skills Without it all 
other skills are handicapped Attitude is a powerful differentiator in a world of fierce competition riddled 
with pick me pick me competitors 

One of the emerging challenges of our times is not about price or product performanceits about 
providing aftersales service that exceeds the expected that delivers the  Solution Use effective 
implementation and followup strategies to minimize your customer attrition rate Complacency is the 
most common thief of good customers Let them know frequently that you think of them and you still 
love em 

Again congratulations on a successful journey through your Sequential Model I leave you with three 
powerful words JUST DID IT 

PS I would love to know how these strategies are helping you Send me your success stories at  
timspectraincom or fax me at  
Thank you
